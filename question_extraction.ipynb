      "is so? How do the concentrations used here in mg/kg relate to the concentrations used in the\n",

D10 cells are T lymphoblasts that continuously proliferate without stimulation, thereby exhibiting cancer cell properties. It is important to demonstrate this phenomenon occuring in vivo using primary T cells. \\n2.
