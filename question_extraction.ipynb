      "Answer found in chunk: Online encyclopedias, like Wikipedia, have a distributed authorship, which is different from earlier encyclopedias where authors were known. This distributed authorship brings issues such as articles being poor or dominated by the erroneous views of non-expert individuals.\n",
      "Finding answer for question: What was the reasoning for singling out thunderstorm scientists as having incomplete understanding of physical phenomena?\n",
      "Answer found in chunk: Are all details of physical phenomena ever completely understood? (This implies a questioning of whether any scientists, including those studying thunderstorms, have *complete* understanding, rather than singling them out specifically.)\n",
      "Finding answer for question: What is the connection between the material in lines 300-309 and the rest of the article?\n",
      "Answer found in chunk: The material in lines 300-309 (now Chapter 1) provides the motivation for the work – studying the development of descriptions and explanations of lightning and thunder over time using encyclopedias as a source – and outlines the structure of the article by detailing what each chapter will examine chronologically.\n",

      "Answer found in chunk: The rebuttal states that rotary-resonance conditions arise due to the periodic dependence, and are not due to the amplitude or width of the distribution (either external magnetic field or radio-frequency field irradiation). While these factors influence the width, modulation frequency, and minimum intensity of the spin-lock signal, the core phenomenon isn't dependent on them. This implies that such conditions would be expected even in a truly liquid-like sample with picosecond timescale tumbling.\n",
      "Finding answer for question: Is there a justification for summing over n=1,2 in Eq S3, or is this motivated by experimental observations?\n",
      "Answer found in chunk: The summation over n=1,2 in Eq S3 is motivated by the modeling of the spatial rf-field distribution using distribution functions f_B1 and f_nu1, which are used to compute the total signal as a weighted average.\n",

      "Finding answer for question: What is the minimum amplitude of radiofrequency (RF) modulations, relative to the nominal RF amplitude, needed to observe the reported phenomenon?\n",
      "Answer found in chunk: The amplitude and width of the distribution influence the width of the rotary-resonance conditions, the modulation frequency, and the minimum intensity of the spin-lock signal at these conditions, but the rotary-resonance conditions arise due to the periodic dependence.\n",
      "Finding answer for question: Is it sufficient to consider inhomogeneity distribution along one axis in both scenarios, and if so, why?\n",
      "Answer found in chunk: The rebuttal states that considering the inhomogeneity distribution along one axis (the rotor axis) is sufficient because the rotary-resonance conditions arise due to the periodic dependence, not the amplitude or width of the distribution. While amplitude and width influence the width, modulation frequency, and minimum intensity of the spin-lock signal, the fundamental conditions are based on the periodic dependence.\n",
      "Finding answer for question: What is the experimental radiofrequency (rf) field inhomogeneity?\n",
      "Answer found in chunk: The spatial radiofrequency (rf) field inhomogeneity was modeled using distribution functions f_B1 (amplitude distribution along the rotor axis) and f_nu1 (magnitude of the modulated component along the y axis).\n",
      "Finding answer for question: What are the specific terms included in Eq S2 of the simulation details?\n",

All the data presented in this manuscript are generated by T cell lines or T cell \\u201cclone\\u201d. D10 cells are T lymphoblasts that continuously proliferate without stimulation, thereby exhibiting cancer cell properties. It is important to demonstrate this phenomenon occuring in vivo using primary T cells. \\n2. It isn\\u2019t very unclear how TCR internalization was measured by using anti-TCR antibody in the beginning and the end of incubation; this could be explained better. \\n3.
