  "Please see the attached review. I think this manuscript has a lot of promise. See my comments for thoughts on how certain\npotential issues could be addressed and how the addition of specific points of information could be of use.\n\nTitle\nI do not see a reason why the word “future” should be in quotations. It’s meaning does not seem different because of it, so I\nwould remove the quotations from the title.\n\nAbstract\nStarting at line 6, the abstract becomes hard to understand. That sentence is grammatically incorrect, then o the following\nsentence on line 9 the combination of more and less likely in the same sentence is confusing. Please split these into\nseparate sentences.\n\nIntroduction\n1. I like the framing used in the first paragraph of the Introduction, but I also want to highlight that climate change and other\nissues are not entirely zero-sum. There are certainly instances where an action taken for the future could also be beneficial\nfor the present. For instance, preserving a forest and protecting animals (or natural beauty in general). I think it’s worth\nacknowledging this caveat to the author(s) overarching and broad-sweeps claims about the issue.\n\n2. For the paragraph starting at line 45, it is also worth acknowledging that it is possible for someone to be acknowledged\nposthumously. In fact, legacy motivation is a strong driver of sustainable behaviors (see work by Markowitz and colleagues,\nSyropoulos and colleagues). So I think that although reputation might not be the primary driver, wanting to be remembered\nas a good person by future people could be, for some, a motivator.\n\n3. I think line 63 is not an exhaustive listing of the relevant variables predicting intergenerational decision-making. Some\ncandidate constructs that come to mind include: impartial intergenerational beneficence, legacy motivations/concerns, future\nself-continuity, consideration of future consequences, and moral obligation/responsibility to future generations. A review of\nthese can be found in this recent paper:\nLaw, K. F., Colaizzi, G., & Syropoulos, S.(2025). Climate change is an intergenerational challenge that requires\n\nintergenerationally focused behavioral solutions. Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences, 71, 101467.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2024.101467\n\n4. I don’t agree with the authors that legacy motives and responsibility fall under the umbrella of generativity. I have not seen\nthat argument before. It is an interesting one, but ultimately, my reading of the literature is that generativity is a construct that\nis more biologically rooted, and one that focuses on one’s own kin and the life stage during which people start feeling a\nmotivation to help improve the lives of their own descendants. Legacy is more broadly concerns about how one’s\nremembered. A person without kids can have legacy concerns, and concerns that are motivated by prosocial or egotistical\nmotives. Similarly, responsibility to future generations is also a sense of obligation felt to protect future people more broadly,\nand not just one’s own descendants. I think these should be distinguished from the umbrella of generativity and discussed\nas separate and related constructs. See an example in Syropoulos and colleagues.\nSyropoulos, S., Mah, A., & Markowitz, E. (2023). Personal legacy: A psychological mechanism for increasing climate action\nand coping with climate change stressors. Journal of Mental Health and Climate Change, 1, 16-29.\nhttp://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8320457\n\n5. Line 85. Please provide a citation for the definition of legacy.\n\nStudy 1\n1. I really liked the design of Study 1, and felt that the authors provided a very clear explanation of it. I think Table 1 is a bit\nconfusing. I am not sure what the third column means. So I would recommend revising it for clarity, or simply removing that\ntable as the Figures that follow capture the same information.\n\n2. I think for Table 3, it’d be very useful to add effect sizes (maybe Cohen’s d) for each comparison. Also, adding ** for p <.01,\nand *** for p <.001 would be a nice addition too.\n\n3. I appreciate the mediation test, but I have a question here. What were the correlations between all variables? It would be\ngood to know, incase there are multi-collinearity issues.\n\nStudy 2\nI have the same comments regarding effect sizes, correlations between variables, and p values. Other than these, the design\nwas a nice addition and replication of Study 1 in an intergroup context.\n\nDiscussion\nI enjoyed the discussion. I think the only addition here would be the authors speculation of what we can do to overcome this\noutgroup derogation and ingroup favoritism effect in intergenerational decisions. This could spark interesting directions in\nthe field of study.\n\nMinor Comments\n1. Rather than saying “more specifically” simply say “specifically”. The word more does not add any additional value.",
  "REVIEW OF COMMSPSYCHOL-25-0028\n\n[\"Intergenerational Intergroup Cooperation\"]\n\nSUMMARY: The paper presents two studies in which participants play ‘intergenerational’ economic games with either\ningroup, outgroup, or neutral recipients in later generations. The paper's main finding is that, participants exhibit ingroup\nfavoritism and outgroup derogation also when playing in this intergenerational setting.\n\nEVALUATION: To the best of my knowledge the research design is novel and represents an interesting addition to the\nliterature concerning ingroup favoritism; moreover, the findings appear replicable and robust to group context (minimal vs.\nnational). The main weaknesses of the paper are an unnecessary use of deception and a lack of external validity.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: reject\n\nMAIN REMARKS:\n\n(A) Section 8.07a of the APA’s Ethics Code reads: “Psychologists do not conduct a study involving deception unless they\nhave determined that the use of deceptive techniques is justified by the study's significant prospective scientific, educational,\nor applied value and that effective nondeceptive alternative procedures are not feasible.” The present study violates this\ncode in at least four ways: (i) participants are led to believe that multiple (!) ‘generations’ of other participants will be involved\nin the study (see page 39/51 of the experimental instructions), which is not the case. There is only one future generation. It\nwould have been easily feasible to include a third generation in Studies 1 and 2, i.e., to not deceive participants. (ii)\nAdditionally, for Study 2 it is not clear to me if the authors invited participants for the second generation at all. (iii) It remains\nfurther unclear if the second generation in both studies were paid and if (iv) they were actually composed of ingroup or\noutgroup members.\nAll four mentioned problems indicate unnecessary deception towards the participants. They are severe enough to make me\nrecommend rejection of this paper. I’m aware, though, that this is a strict reading of the Ethics Code and so I’m fine with\n\nhaving my opinion be overruled by a less strict view of the editor and/or a majority of other reviewers.\n\n(B) External validity: I doubt that using an ISDG in an online setting adequately approximates intergenerational dynamics. Its\nsequence resembles that of a standard dictator game and thus the results might not be interpretable as intergenerational at\nall: what is missing completely in the design is the present generation’s stake in the outcomes of the future generation\n(usually: parents would care for their kids’ wellbeing). A refined experimental design would add such a dimension (ideally as\nan experimental condition) and would further test whether the ‘generation’-story matters at all by removing the deceptive\nthird and later generations to test for any effect of such time horizon. Finally: what type of situation do the authors have in\nmind with their outgroup condition? Which realistically relevant actions can I take which only affect outgroup members in the\nfuture? Climate change, for example, affects both in- and outgroup future generations. Same for most (all?) other\nenvironmental dilemmas.\nThus, it remains unclear if the choice of ISDG allows for the results to be generalized to the broad societal implications the\npaper lists in both introduction and discussion. This is also admitted by the authors themselves. Accordingly, the authors\nmight want to discuss more fitting societal applications for their experimental design.\n\nStatistics:\nThe chosen statistical models are to the best of my knowledge applicable for the intended interpretation and the research\nobjectives. The hypotheses are preregistered, and the interpretation of the data is well done. However, given that choosing\nthe cooperative option in every generation would maximize social welfare, efficiency and social welfare concerns of the\nparticipants could have been taken into account when eliciting and analyzing the data.\n\nMINOR COMMENTS:\n\nThe authors should provide additional data to show that the MGI-task induced social identification in the participants. (lines\n169 - 172)\n\nThe procedure contains a mistake: 10% of the 1400 participants of Study 1 are 140, not as stated 60. If these 60 participants\nwere selected from the pilot data this should be clearly stated. (Lines 188 - 189).\n\nThere are many spelling and grammatical mistakes throughout, for example in lines 161, 166, 167 and 367.",
  "REVIEW OF COMMSPSYCHOL-25-0028A\n\n[\"Intergenerational Intergroup Cooperation\"]\n\nSUMMARY: The paper presents two studies in which participants play ‘intergenerational’ economic games with either\ningroup, outgroup, or neutral recipients in later generations. The paper's main finding is that participants exhibit ingroup\nfavoritism and outgroup derogation also when playing in this intergenerational setting.\n\nEVALUATION: To the best of my knowledge the research design is novel and represents an interesting addition to the\nliterature concerning ingroup favoritism; moreover, the findings appear replicable and robust to group context (minimal vs.\nnational). The revision addressed most of my concerns and I recommend to accept this contribution after very minor\nrevisions (see below).\n\nRECOMMENDATION: minor revision\n\nMAIN REMARKS AFTER REVISION:\n\nDeception:\nThe revised text improved the clarity of the experimental method. While I still view the instructions and graphics shown to the\nparticipants as somewhat deceptive regarding the existence of multiple future generations, in its current form the study’s\nstrengths and weaknesses are clear and can thus be assessed by each reader individually. The clarification that Study 2 is\nan unincentivized vignette is sufficient, as is the added clarification on the payment of the second generation in Study 1. I\nwould however further add a description of how the second generation in Study 1 was matched. This was well formulated in\nthe authors’ response to my initial review but is still absent from the paper's text.\n\nExternal Validity:\nThe provided clarification shows that ISDGs are commonly applied in these settings.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe added examples in the discussion point to fitting real-world equivalents of the stylized decisions of the ISDG.\n\nWelfare Effects:\n\nThe revision makes it clear that the mentioned individual welfare considerations were not of interest for the authors’ research\nobjectives, the provided clarification suffices. I would have considered a differentiation of these effects as a further\nimprovement of the contribution, but this can also be achieved as part of further examinations in future projects."
