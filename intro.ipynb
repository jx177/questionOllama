      "\n",
      "(A) Section 8.07a of the APA’s Ethics Code reads: “Psychologists do not conduct a study involving deception unless they\n",
      "have determined that the use of deceptive techniques is justified by the study's significant prospective scientific, educational,\n",
      "or applied value and that effective nondeceptive alternative procedures are not feasible.” The present study violates this\n",
      "code in at least four ways: (i) participants are led to believe that multiple (!) ‘generations’ of other participants will be involved\n",
      "in the study (see page 39/51 of the experimental instructions), which is not the case. There is only one future generation. It\n",
      "would have been easily feasible to include a third generation in Studies 1 and 2, i.e., to not deceive participants. (ii)\n",
      "Additionally, for Study 2 it is not clear to me if the authors invited participants for the second generation at all. (iii) It remains\n",
      "further unclear if the second generation in both studies were paid and if (iv) they were actually composed of ingroup or\n",
      "outgroup members.\n",
      "All four mentioned problems indicate unnecessary deception towards the participants. They are severe enough to make me\n",
      "recommend rejection of this paper. I’m aware, though, that this is a strict reading of the Ethics Code and so I’m fine with\n",
      "\n",
      "having my opinion be overruled by a less strict view of the editor and/or a majority of other reviewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "(B) External validity: I doubt that using an ISDG in an online setting adequately approximates intergenerational dynamics. Its\n",
      "sequence resembles that of a standard dictator game and thus the results might not be interpretable as intergenerational at\n",
      "all: what is missing completely in the design is the present generation’s stake in the outcomes of the future generation\n",

      "future? Climate change, for example, affects both in- and outgroup future generations. Same for most (all?) other\n",
      "environmental dilemmas.\n",
      "Thus, it remains unclear if the choice of ISDG allows for the results to be generalized to the broad societal implications the\n",

      "might want to discuss more fitting societal applications for their experimental design.\n",
