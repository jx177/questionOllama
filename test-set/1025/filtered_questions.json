    "How does the mapped tagset compare to the annotation scheme used in the existing UD Thai treebank, specifically regarding the decision not to use the ADJ tag?",
    "How does the conversion process used in this paper compare to the conversion used in the existing Thai UD treebank (Thai PUD)?",
    "What is the extent of the variation in the results due to factors like random initialization and test set split?",
    "How does the tag distribution before and after the conversion from ORCHID to UD?",
    "Is it possible to combine syllable information with BERT models to potentially improve performance, and have any such experiments been conducted?",
    "How does the performance of POS tagging with UD-style tags compare to that with ORCHID tags, and which tagset is easier for taggers to learn?",
    "Why did multi-lingual BERT fail to improve performance, even on out-of-vocabulary words?",
    "How are syllables generated automatically from Thai words, and is there ambiguity in this process, requiring a heuristic?",
    "Why did using a pre-trained model hurt performance compared to simpler models?"
