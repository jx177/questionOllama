    "Does the ORCHID corpus already provide word segmentation and train/dev/test splits, and if not, how were they produced?",
    "Why did the multi-lingual BERT model fail, even on in-vocabulary words?",
    "What was the tag distribution before and after the conversion from ORCHID to UD?",
    "What was the motivation for converting the ORCHID tagset to the UD tagset?",
    "Why did pre-training the model hurt performance compared to simpler models?",
    "How are syllables generated automatically for Thai words, and is there ambiguity in splitting Thai words into syllables?",
    "What is the amount of variation in the results due to factors like random initialization and test set splits?",
    "Why was JSON chosen as the format for the mapped ORCHID corpus instead of the more standard CoNLL-U format?",
    "Why wasn't a comparison performed between the systems tested with both the ORCHID and UD tagsets?",
    "Is it possible to combine syllable information with BERT models to potentially improve performance?",
    "How does the conversion process used in this paper compare to the conversion used in the existing Thai UD treebank (Thai PUD)?",
    "What specific steps were taken in the conversion process from ORCHID to UD, and why were sub-types not mapped to morphological features?",
    "How does the mapped tagset compare to the annotation scheme used in the existing UD Thai treebank?",
    "How does the performance of POS tagging with UD-style tags compare to that with ORCHID tags, and does the loss of information when mapping from ORCHID to UD significantly affect tagger performance?"
