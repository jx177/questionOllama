    "How does the mapped tagset compare to the annotation scheme used in the existing UD Thai treebank?",
    "How are syllables generated automatically from Thai words—is the process unambiguous, or does it require a heuristic?",
    "Is it possible to combine syllable information with BERT models, and if so, has this been attempted by combining syllable-level and BERT word representations?",
    "Does the ORCHID corpus already provide word segmentation and train/dev/test splits, and if not, how were these produced?",
    "Why was the JSON format chosen for the mapped ORCHID corpus instead of the CoNLL-U format, which is standard for UD resources?",
    "How does the performance of POS tagging with UD-style tags compare to that with ORCHID tags—which is easier for taggers to learn?",
    "Given that the ORCHID tagset is more fine-grained than the UD tagset, does the information loss resulting from the mapping significantly impact tagger performance?",
    "What was the motivation for converting the ORCHID tagset to the UD tagset, given that the conversion appears to be lossy?",
    "What was the process used for converting the ORCHID tagset to the UD tagset, and what attention was given to mapping sub-types to morphological features?",
    "What would the results have been if the systems tested were evaluated using both the original ORCHID tagset and the converted UD tagset?",
    "How does the conversion process used in this paper compare to the conversion used in the existing Thai UD treebank (Thai PUD)?",
    "What was the tag distribution in the dataset before and after the conversion to the UD tagset?",
    "Why did multi-lingual BERT fail to improve performance, even on out-of-vocabulary words?",
    "Why did pre-training the model *hurt* performance compared to simpler models?",
    "What is the variance of the results for each model, considering factors like random initialization and test set splits?",
    "Why does the syllable-based model (without pre-training) perform as well as BERT on in-vocabulary words, according to the results presented?"
