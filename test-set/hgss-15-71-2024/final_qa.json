    "What are the key issues related to distributed authorship in online encyclopedias, compared to the authorship of earlier encyclopedias?": "Online encyclopedias, like Wikipedia, have a distributed authorship, which is different from earlier encyclopedias where authors were known. This distributed authorship brings issues such as articles being poor or dominated by the erroneous views of non-expert individuals.",
    "What was the reasoning for singling out thunderstorm scientists as having incomplete understanding of physical phenomena?": "Are all details of physical phenomena ever completely understood? (This implies a questioning of whether any scientists, including those studying thunderstorms, have *complete* understanding, rather than singling them out specifically.)",
    "What is the connection between the material in lines 300-309 and the rest of the article?": "The material in lines 300-309 (now Chapter 1) provides the motivation for the work – studying the development of descriptions and explanations of lightning and thunder over time using encyclopedias as a source – and outlines the structure of the article by detailing what each chapter will examine chronologically."
