    "What are the key issues related to distributed authorship in online encyclopedias, compared to the authorship of earlier encyclopedias?": "Online encyclopedias, like Wikipedia, have a distributed authorship, which is different from earlier encyclopedias where authors were known. This distributed authorship brings issues such as articles being poor or dominated by the erroneous views of non-expert individuals.",
    "What was the reasoning for singling out thunderstorm scientists as having incomplete understanding of physical phenomena?": "Are all details of physical phenomena ever completely understood? (This implies a questioning of whether any scientists, including those studying thunderstorms, have *complete* understanding, rather than singling them out specifically.)"
