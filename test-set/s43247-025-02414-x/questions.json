    "How does the unit of wave power translate to W/m (Watts per meter) from the provided formula, which is the product of squared significant height and wave period?",
    "What is the source or reference for the wave power formula used in the study?",
    "How can wave power be negative, as indicated in the figures?",
    "Why does the latitude scale on the y-axis vary in distance between figures 2b, c, d, and e, compared to figure 2a?",
    "What is the rationale behind the chosen color palette, where higher wave power and sea level are represented in reddish tones and lower values in bluish tones, while the representation is reversed for wave direction and waterline position?",
    "What was the specific reason for discarding 40% of transects from non-sandy beaches?",
    "What is the unit of wave energy as presented in Figure S3, given that the wave energy formula is identical to the wave power formula used in Figure 2?",
    "What was the basis for dividing the North American West Coast (NAWC) into five subregions?",
    "Were any additional studies conducted to determine if parameters such as beach slope, substrate lithology, or riverine sediment inputs significantly affect waterline positions on a seasonal scale?"
