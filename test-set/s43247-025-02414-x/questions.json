    "What is the reference for the wave power formula used in the study?",
    "What specific climatological or geomorphological features define the lateral boundaries of the PNW, NCA, and other study areas?",
    "Were any additional studies conducted to determine if parameters like beach slope, substrate lithology, or riverine sediment inputs significantly affect seasonal waterline positions?",
    "What is the rationale behind the color palette used, where higher wave power and sea level are represented in reddish tones and lower values in bluish tones, while the representation is reversed for wave direction and waterline position?",
    "How is the unit of wave power translated to W/m from the formula provided, which is the product of squared significant height and wave period?",
    "What was the basis for dividing the North American West Coast (NAWC) into five subregions?",
    "What specific criteria were used to justify the removal of 40% of transects from non-sandy beaches?",
    "How can wave power be negative, given the observed range of -2000 to 2000 W/m?",
    "How do geomorphic processes influence the response of waterlines to ENSO events?"
