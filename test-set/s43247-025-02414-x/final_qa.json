    "What was the specific reason for discarding 40% of transects from non-sandy beaches?": "Sandy beaches are highly dynamic systems that experience frequent changes due to erosion and accretion over short timescales (episodic, seasonal, interannual) up to geological timescales. In contrast, rocky coasts (main type of non-sandy beach along the NAWC) change more gradually over geological timescales. Since our study focuses on the influence of seasonal to interannual climate variability on coastal change, we excluded non-sandy coasts to maintain consistency in the timescales analyzed. Furthermore, the detection methods used in this study were specifically designed to monitor sandy beaches, and non-sandy coasts exhibit much lower rates of change, which would likely result in a high noise-to-signal ratio and reduced reliability of",
    "What is the reference source for the wave power formula used in the study?": "The actual formula used to generate the data is] *P* *wave* *g* [2] *H* *s* [2] *[T]* *[p]* [{p][64] *[]* [q][.",
    "What was the basis for dividing the NAWC into five subregions?": "Sandy beaches are highly dynamic systems that experience frequent changes due to erosion and accretion over short timescales (episodic, seasonal, interannual) up to geological timescales. In contrast, rocky coasts (main type of non-sandy beach along the NAWC) change more gradually over geological timescales.

    "Were any additional studies conducted to confirm that parameters such as beach slope, substrate lithology, or riverine sediment inputs do not significantly affect waterline positions on a seasonal scale?": "Sandy beaches are highly dynamic systems that experience frequent changes due to erosion and accretion over short timescales (episodic, seasonal, interannual) up to geological timescales.

    "How does the unit of wave power translate from the formula provided?": "The displayed values of wave power, approximately ranging from -2000 to +2000 W/m, represent de meaned values of seasonal variability around the mean. The units are correctly W/m (watts per meter); however, the formula described in the figure caption ( *H* *s* [2] *[T]* *[p]* [) was incorrect. The actual formula used to generate the data is] *P* *wave* *g* [2] *H* *s* [2] *[T]* *[p]* [{p][64] *[]* [q][."
