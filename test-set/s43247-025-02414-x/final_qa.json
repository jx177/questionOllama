    "What is the reference for the wave power formula used in the study?": "The actual formula used to generate the data is Pwave = g [2] Hs [2] [T] [p] [{p][64] * []* [q][. The reference for this formula is [2].",
    "What specific climatological or geomorphological features define the lateral boundaries of the PNW, NCA, and other study areas?": "The Pacific Northwest corresponds to Washington, Oregon, and the northernmost part of California, while the boundaries between Southern California, Baja California, and Baja California Sur follow administrative borders. California was divided into two subregions based on distinct coastal conditions like coastline orientation, wave climate, and shoreline variability.",
    "Were any additional studies conducted to determine if parameters like beach slope, substrate lithology, or riverine sediment inputs significantly affect seasonal waterline positions?": "The rebuttal does not directly address whether studies were conducted to determine if beach slope, substrate lithology, or riverine sediment inputs affect seasonal waterline positions. However, it states the authors revised the manuscript to include statistical relationships between key drivers (wave power and direction, and monthly-mean sea level) and waterline positions, suggesting an attempt to quantify relationships between drivers and waterline positions.",
    "How is the unit of wave power translated to W/m from the formula provided, which is the product of squared significant height and wave period?": "The units are correctly W/m (watts per meter), though the formula described in the figure caption was incorrect. The actual formula used is Pwave = gH^2Tp, where g is gravity, H is significant wave height, T is wave period, and p is a coefficient.",
    "What was the basis for dividing the North American West Coast (NAWC) into five subregions?": "The North American West Coast was divided into five subregions to highlight boundaries and improve readability of a figure, as indicated by the addition of horizontal lines to panels b-e.",
    "What specific criteria were used to justify the removal of 40% of transects from non-sandy beaches?": "Non-sandy coasts were excluded to maintain consistency in the timescales analyzed, as they change more gradually over geological timescales while the study focuses on seasonal to interannual climate variability. Additionally, the detection methods were designed for sandy beaches, and non-sandy coasts exhibit lower rates of change, potentially leading to a high noise-to-signal ratio and reduced reliability.",
    "How can wave power be negative, given the observed range of -2000 to 2000 W/m?": "The displayed values of wave power, ranging from -2000 to +2000 W/m, represent de-meaned values of seasonal variability around the mean.",
    "How do geomorphic processes influence the response of waterlines to ENSO events?": "The claims regarding ENSO and PDO events with waterline position are well explained."
