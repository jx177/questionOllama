    "What is the source or reference for the wave power formula used in the study?",
    "How does the unit of wave power translate to W/m (Watts per meter) from the provided formula, which is the product of squared significant height and wave period?",
    "Were any additional studies conducted to determine if parameters such as beach slope, substrate lithology, or riverine sediment inputs significantly affect waterline positions on a seasonal scale?",
    "What is the rationale behind the chosen color palette, where higher wave power and sea level are represented in reddish tones and lower values in bluish tones, while the representation is reversed for wave direction and waterline position?",
    "What was the basis for dividing the North American West Coast (NAWC) into five subregions?"
