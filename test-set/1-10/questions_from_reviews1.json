    "Given that all data is generated from T cell lines or clones, is it important to demonstrate the observed phenomenon *in vivo* using primary T cells?",
    "How was TCR internalization measured using an anti-TCR antibody at the beginning and end of incubation, and could this methodology be explained in more detail?",
    "Given that differences exist between the cell populations used in this study and those in cited works, how important are these differences in explaining discrepancies in findings?",
    "Regarding the use of stimulating versus inhibiting anti-Tim1 antibodies in mouse systems, is the observed difference in effect due to differences in Tim1 localization within or opposed to the immunological synapse (IS)?",
    "Regarding the claim that the data supports a certain interpretation, what specific data points lead to this interpretation, and is there alternative data that could support a different interpretation?",
    "Given the observed polarized distribution of Tim1, what experiments could be performed using primary T cells to confirm this finding?",
    "Considering the tyrosine phosphorylation data, what experiments could be done to investigate the effects of Tim1 mutations on the distribution of signaling molecules?"
