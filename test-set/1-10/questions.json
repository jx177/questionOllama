    "How was TCR internalization measured using an anti-TCR antibody at the beginning and end of the incubation period?",
    "Is there a rationale for using continuously proliferating T lymphoblasts (D10 cells) instead of primary T cells to study this phenomenon?",
    "Given that different anti-Tim1 antibodies can either stimulate or inhibit T cell activation in mouse models, how do the antibodies used in this study affect Tim1 localization within or opposed to the immunological synapse?",
    "What experiments would confirm the polarized distribution of Tim1 using primary T cells?",
    "What is the expected effect of Tim1 mutations on the distribution of signaling molecules, and how would demonstrating this support the tyrosine phosphorylation data?"
