    "How was TCR internalization measured using anti-TCR antibody at the beginning and end of incubation?",
    "What evidence demonstrates the observed phenomenon occurring in vivo using primary T cells, given that all data was generated using T cell lines or clones?",
    "What accounts for the differences in observed findings compared to those reported in other studies?",
    "What is the rationale for selecting specific reagents for the analysis, given the existence of both stimulatory and inhibitory anti-Tim1 antibodies in mouse systems?",
    "How might differences in the cell populations used in this study and cited works impact the observed results?",
    "What experiments could be performed to confirm the polarized distribution of Tim1 using primary T cells?",
    "What data would support the claim that Tim1 mutations affect the distribution of signaling molecules, and how would this relate to the observed tyrosine phosphorylation data?"
