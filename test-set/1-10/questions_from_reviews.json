    "How can the authors demonstrate that the observed phenomena occur *in vivo* using primary T cells?",
    "Can the authors clarify the methodology used to measure TCR internalization, specifically addressing the timing of the anti-TCR antibody application?",
    "What is the rationale for using T cell lines or clones instead of primary T cells to generate the data presented in the manuscript?",
    "What is the role of Tim1 localization (in or opposed to the IS) in the observed differences between findings in this paper and those reported elsewhere?",
    "Do differences in the cell populations used in this and cited works prove important?",
    "What specific data led to the reviewerâ€™s concern that the manuscript over interprets the data?",
    "What type of primary T cells should be used to confirm the polarized distribution of Tim1?",
    "What specific signaling molecules should be investigated to understand the effects of Tim1 mutations on tyrosine phosphorylation?"
