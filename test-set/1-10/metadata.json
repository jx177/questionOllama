During this process, many receptors and signaling proteins segregate to regions proximal to the synapse. This protein movement is thought to influence T cell function. However, some proteins are transported away from the IS, which is controlled in part by ERM family proteins. Tim-1 is a transmembrane protein with co-stimulatory functions that is found on many immune cells, including T cells. However, the expression pattern of Tim-1 on T cells upon activation by APCs has not been explored. Interestingly, in this study we demonstrate that the majority of Tim-1 on activated T cells is excluded from the IS. Tim-1 predominantly resides outside of the IS, and structure/function studies indicate that the cytoplasmic tail influences Tim-1 polarization. Specifically, a putative ERM binding motif (KRK 244-246) in the Tim-1 cytoplasmic tail appears necessary for proper Tim-1 localization. Furthermore, mutation of the KRK motif results in enhanced early tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of TCR/CD28 stimulation upon ectopic expression of Tim-1. Paradoxically however, the KRK motif is necessary for Tim-1 co-stimulation of NFAT/AP-1 activation and co-stimulation of cytokine production. This work reveals unexpected complexity underlying Tim-1 localization and suggests potentially novel mechanisms by which Tim-1 modulates T cell activity.", "url": "https://f1000research.com/articles/1-10/v2/", "doc_id": "1-10", "year": "2012", "authors": ["Jean Lin", "Leo Chen", "Lawrence P Kane"]}
