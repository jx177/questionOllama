    "Would one expect the observed enhanced magnetization decay at rotary-resonance conditions in a truly liquid-like sample, such as glycine in water, where molecular tumbling occurs on the picosecond timescale?": "The rebuttal states that rotary-resonance conditions arise due to the periodic dependence, and are not due to the amplitude or width of the distribution (either external magnetic field or radio-frequency field irradiation). While these factors influence the width, modulation frequency, and minimum intensity of the spin-lock signal, the core phenomenon isn't dependent on them. This implies that such conditions would be expected even in a truly liquid-like sample with picosecond timescale tumbling.",
    "Is there a justification for summing over n=1,2 in Eq S3, or is this motivated by experimental observations?": "The summation over n=1,2 in Eq S3 is motivated by the modeling of the spatial rf-field distribution using distribution functions f_B1 and f_nu1, which are used to compute the total signal as a weighted average.",
    "What is the rationale for restricting the study to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and rubber, rather than other materials?": "The text does not contain an answer to the question about the rationale for restricting the study to polyethylene glycol (PEG) and rubber.",
    "What is the minimum amplitude of radiofrequency (RF) modulations, relative to the nominal RF amplitude, needed to observe the reported phenomenon?": "The amplitude and width of the distribution influence the width of the rotary-resonance conditions, the modulation frequency, and the minimum intensity of the spin-lock signal at these conditions, but the rotary-resonance conditions arise due to the periodic dependence.",
    "Is it sufficient to consider inhomogeneity distribution along one axis in both scenarios, and if so, why?": "The rebuttal states that considering the inhomogeneity distribution along one axis (the rotor axis) is sufficient because the rotary-resonance conditions arise due to the periodic dependence, not the amplitude or width of the distribution. While amplitude and width influence the width, modulation frequency, and minimum intensity of the spin-lock signal, the fundamental conditions are based on the periodic dependence.",
    "What is the experimental radiofrequency (rf) field inhomogeneity?": "The spatial radiofrequency (rf) field inhomogeneity was modeled using distribution functions f_B1 (amplitude distribution along the rotor axis) and f_nu1 (magnitude of the modulated component along the y axis).",
    "What are the specific terms included in Eq S2 of the simulation details?": "The terms included in Eq S2 are the initial density operator and the detection operator, both corresponding to Ix (x magnetization).",
    "What is the reasoning behind choosing a biquadrate exponential distribution function for f(ν₁)?": "The authors model the spatial rf-field distribution using a distribution function f_nu1, which models the magnitude of the modulated component along the y-axis.",
    "What is the extent to which residual dipolar couplings might contribute to the observed enhanced relaxation in the rubber and polymer samples?": "The rebuttal does not directly address the contribution of residual dipolar couplings to enhanced relaxation in rubber and polymer samples. Therefore, the answer is none.",
    "What is the molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) used in the study?": "The polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecular weight is not mentioned in the provided text.",
    "Where exactly does the second recoupling condition at two times ωR originate—from MAS modulations of residual dipolar couplings or from RF field modulation?": "The appearance of rotary resonance conditions in isotropic samples is not due to the amplitude or width of the distribution (either external magnetic field or radio-frequency field irradiation), but rather due to the periodic dependence. While amplitude and width influence the width, modulation frequency, and minimum intensity of the spin-lock signal at these conditions."
