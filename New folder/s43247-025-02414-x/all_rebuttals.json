  "\n\n# **Point-by-point response to reviewers**\n\nWe appreciate the time and effort the editor and reviewers have spent reading and reviewing our manuscript.\n\nWe have responded to all of the comments and questions one by one in the letter below, and addressed/clarified\n\nany concerns raised. Please note that the reviewers’ comments and questions are shown in black, and our responses\n\nare shown in blue .\n\nThe in-depth revision of our manuscript led to changes and inputs of figures in our main manuscript and\n\nsupplementary materials. To better address the comments and questions of the journal’s and the USGS’s internal\n\nreviewers, we made changes in the order of figures and tables in the main manuscript and Supplementary, along\n\nwith adding new figures/tables. The table below shows the new order of these figures/tables:\n\n|Previous label|New label|\n|---|---|\n|Figure 1|Figure 1|\n|Figure 2|Figure 2|\n|Figure 3|Figure 3|\n|N/A|Figure 4|\n|Figure 4|Figure 5|\n|N/A|Table 1|\n|Figure S1|Figure S1|\n|Table S1|Table S1|\n|N/A|Figure S2|\n|N/A|Figure S3|\n|N/A|Figure S4|\n|N/A|Figure S5|\n|N/A|Figure S6|\n|N/A|Figure S7|\n|Figure S3|Figure S8|\n|Figure S4|Figure S9|\n|Figure S5|Figure S10|\n|Figure S6|Figure S11|\n|Figure S7|Figure S12|\n\n\n\nTable R1: Changes made to the order of figures and tables in the main manuscript and Supplementary after the\n1st round of revision\n\nThe marked-up version of the manuscript shows in red the deleted parts and in blue the added parts. Responses\n\nto the reviewers’ comments indicate line numbers where changes have been made, these line numbers refer to the\n\nrevised (unmarked) manuscript.\n\n1\n\n### **Reviewer #1**\n\nAuthors have perfectly employed waterline extraction and tide correction techniques. The methods adopted for\n\ntrend and seasonal calculations, along with EP and CP indices sounds good. The claims of the authors, regarding\n\nENSO and PDO events with waterline position are well explained. Following points has been raised regarding the\n\nmanuscript:\n\nWe thank Reviewer #1 for their supportive comment and for the relevant points raised. We hope our responses\n\nand revised manuscript respond to their questions/concerns.\n\n01. Regarding Figure 02: a) How the unit of wave power is translating to W/m (I suppose it is Watt per meter)\n\nfrom the formula mentioned, i.e., product of squared significant height and wave period? b) What is the reference\n\nof the formula of wave power that has been used? c) From the figure it is evident that wave power roughly ranges\n\nbetween -2000 to 2000 W/m. How can wave power be negative? d) Regarding Fig. 2b, c, d and e, why the latitude\n\nin y-axis is not maintaining fixed distance, like Fig. 2a? e) Regarding the colour palette, higher wave power and\n\nsea level is represented in reddish and bluish for low values. This representation is reversed for wave direction and\n\nwaterline position. It would be better if consistency is mentioned, if there is no other reason behind choosing the\n\npalette.\n\nWe thank Rewiewer #1 for raising these critical points on Figure 2. There were indeed inconsistencies in the\n\ndescription of the wave power formula used, its unit and how we labeled it, as well as design choices that could\n\nhave been enhanced.\n\n01-a–c) The displayed values of wave power, approximately ranging from -2000 to +2000 W/m, represent de\nmeaned values of seasonal variability around the mean. The units are correctly W/m (watts per meter); however,\n\nthe formula described in the figure caption ( *H* *s* [2] *[T]* *[p]* [) was incorrect. The actual formula used to generate the data is]\n\n*P* *wave* “ *ρg* [2] *H* *s* [2] *[T]* *[p]* [{p][64] *[π]* [q][. We also have corrected the figure caption and changed to colorbar label on panel b to]\n\n\"Demeaned wave power (W/m)\".\n\n01-d) In Figure 2b–e, the y-axis represents the latitudes of individual transects, which are sorted by their\n\nlatitude. Since the transects are not uniformly distributed along the coastline, and because the study area is not a\n\nperfectly straight, west-facing coast, the y-axis spacing is uneven. We believe that, although this representation is\n\nslightly more complicated, it provides a clearer understanding of the spatial variability in wave climate. We added\n\nhorizontal solid black lines to panels b-e to highlight subregion boundaries and improve the readability of the figure.\n\n01-e) We acknowledge the inconsistency in the color palette. To avoid confusion, we have harmonized the\n\ncolormap across all panels. Higher values are now consistently represented with warm colors (reddish), and lower\n\nvalues with cool colors (bluish), ensuring visual consistency throughout.\n\n02. Authors have mentioned discarding 40% of transects from non-sandy beaches. Is there any specific reason\n\nfor such removal?\n\nSandy beaches are highly dynamic systems that experience frequent changes due to erosion and accretion over\n\nshort timescales (episodic, seasonal, interannual) up to geological timescales. In contrast, rocky coasts (main type\n\nof non-sandy beach along the NAWC) change more gradually over geological timescales. Since our study focuses\n\n2\n\non the influence of seasonal to interannual climate variability on coastal change, we excluded non-sandy coasts\n\nto maintain consistency in the timescales analyzed. Furthermore, the detection methods used in this study were\nspecifically designed to monitor sandy beaches, and non-sandy coasts exhibit much lower rates of change, which\n\nwould likely result in a high noise-to-signal ratio and reduced reliability of the measurements and analysis.\n\n03. In many instances, abbreviations mentioned for the first time in the manuscript are not in expanded form.\n\nFor example, EP and CP are mentioned in line 162, but the expanded form is mentioned in the later part (line\n\n185 and 187). Also, MEI mentioned in the line 267 has not been described in the manuscript (expanded form is\n\nmentioned in Supplementary Fig. 03).\n\nWe thank Reviewer #1 for their comment. Abbreviations are now introduced in their expanded form the\n\nfirst time they are mentionned in the manuscript. Also, EP, CP and MEI are clearly introduced in the revised\n\nIntroduction (lines 96-109).\n\n04. Regarding Figure S3, What is the unit of Wave Energy? The wave energy formula mentioned here is the\n\nsame as the wave power formula mentioned in Figure 02.\n\nIn Figure S3, the unit was [m [2] /s]. It was indeed the same formula as mentioned in former Figure 2. But Figure\n\nS3 (now S8) has been modified, now displaying winter-averaged wave power at four locations along the NAWC\n\ncalculated using the formula *P* *wave* “ *ρg* [2] *H* *s* [2] *[T]* *[p]* [{p][64] *[π]* [q][ (in W/m).]\n\n05. Authors have divided NAWC into five subregions. What was the basis of that classification?\n\nWe thank Reviewer #1 for raising this point. The reasons behind dividing the NAWC into five subregions\n\nwere indeed not fully explained in the manuscript. As mentioned in the Introduction and shown in Figure 1, the\n\nNAWC exhibits contrasting coastal hydrodynamics and varying morphological responses to ENSO (e.g., Barnard\n\net al., 2015). To represent this spatial diversity, and to help us organize our discussion of the study results, we\n\nsubdivided the coastline into regions using several criteria.\n\nFirst, each subregion needed to contain enough usable transects to ensure a representative sample. Second,\n\nwe aimed for subregions that were geographically recognizable and relatable to readers. For instance, the Pacific\n\nNorthwest corresponds to Washington, Oregon, and the northernmost part of California, while the boundaries be\ntween Southern California, Baja California, and Baja California Sur follow administrative borders. Finally, because\n\nCalifornia spans a much larger area than the other subregions, we divided it into two subregions that are distinct\n\nin terms of coastal conditions, such as coastline orientation, wave climate, and resulting shoreline variability (as\n\nrecently highlighted by Warrick et al., 2025). The revised introduction presents a deepen description of the subre\ngions, with emphasis on their wave climate and geomorphological differences (lines 131-158).\n\n3\n\n### **Reviewer #2**\n\n**General Comments**\n\nThis work addresses some long standing and highly relevant questions in the field of coastal dynamics that\n\nhas only been made possible in recent years thanks to the rapid increase in satellite-based shoreline extraction\n\ncapabilities. The authors apply a recently developed method for extracting waterlines from optical satellite imagery\n\nto investigate the relationship between large scale climatic forcing and coastal response along the western coast of\n\nthe US. They derive monthly timeseries of waterline positions along 7000+ 250m-spaced transects and analyse\n\nthe monthly and seasonal signals alongside monthly wave power, wave direction, and sea level data. Their findings\n\nindicate spatially variable coastal response across the region that mirrors difference in incident wave power and\n\nwave direction as well as sea level. The authors hypothesise that climate modes are most likely the key drivers\n\nof a large portion of the observed variability in waterline position and perform statistical analysis of the waterline\n\nposition anomalies and different expressions of ENSO. This analysis leads to only weak and mostly statistically not\n\nsignificant relationships.\n\nWe would like to thank Reviewer #2 for this very thorough review. We have taken due note of all the comments\n\nmade by the reviewer, which have led to substantial changes to the manuscript.\n\nRV1. Structure: The introduction does not provide the necessary background information although most of\n\nthis is present in the results and discussion sections. The are also several sections in the results section that would\n\nbe more appropriately included in the discussion section. Therefore, I would suggest restructuring the manuscript\n\nso that the introduction includes all the necessary background information, the results section includes the presen\ntation of results, and the discussion section only includes a critical analysis/interpretation of the findings. Several\n\nsuggestions have been made in the specific comments that follow.\n\nThis excellent point has led to an in-depth restructuring of the manuscript. Several aspect in the introduc\ntion, especially general knowledge on shoreline change, links between storminess and wave generation, and climate\n\nmodes influence on regional wave climate, have been rigorously introduced to provide readers with all the relevant\n\nbackground to grasp the problem we are adressing and the implications of the presented study. We also removed\n\nopinionated discussion items from the Results section, and deepened our Discussion in line with the many comments\n\nraised by the Reviewer.\n\nRV2. Methods: the methods are clear. However, it is not always clear which approaches the authors have\n\nadopted from previous works and which they are contributing to this work. Also, they do not provide much ex\nplanation as to why the authors use the Eddy kinetic wind energy as a proxy for storm track direction instead of\n\nthe parameters of interest, i.e., storm wave intensity and direction. It would also be useful to provide some link\n\nbetween storm wave parameters of interest and the EKE.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this thoughtful comment. We have clarified our Methods section to detail which\n\nmethodological components are derived from previous studies and which are novel contributions of our work. Most\n\nof these comments were related to deviations from the original approach of Bergsma et al. (2024) which we roughly\n\nreproduced. However, some aspects of this methodology were modified to allow for transferability to our study site\n\nand to handle the scale of our region of interest. We clarified that the index and thresholding method used in this\n\nstudy are from Bergsma et al., (2024) but that other additional processes are original inputs from this work or\n\nadapted from previous works (see lines 486-500).\n\n4\n\nEKE is widely used as a proxy for position and intensity of the storm track as it quantifies the intensity of\n\ntransient atmospheric eddies, which are closely linked to mid-latitude cyclones and storm tracks and ultimately\n\ninfluence wave climate. Several studies support this approach in the literature:\n\n  - Chang et al. (2002) reviewed storm track measures and highlighted EKE’s effectiveness in capturing storm\n\ntrack variability.\n\n  - Hoskins & Valdes (1990) explained how baroclinic eddies, which contribute to EKE, are fundamental to storm\n\ntrack formation and maintenance.\n\n  - Trenberth (1991) used EKE diagnostics to analyze storm track variability and its connection to large-scale\n\natmospheric circulation changes.\n\nWe acknowledge that storm wave intensity and direction are also relevant parameters. However, large-scale\n\nreanalysis products like ERA5 do not provide a direct metric for \"storm wave intensity.\" At the monthly scale,\n\nstorms are smoothed in the significant wave height (Hs) and peak period (Tp) signal. It could eventually be de\nrived from hourly wave data but this approach would be highly computationally demanding and require significant\n\nmethodological adjustments. That said, we agree that this alternative approach could provide additional insight.\n\nWe now state this limitation and included it as a perspective for future work in the Discussion section (lines 384-385).\n\nRV3. Uncertainty: The authors consider various sources of error and uncertainty yet in some cases, it is not\n\nclear how uncertainty is incorporated in the results (e.g., RV43). In other cases, it is not clear how some uncertainty\n\nlimits have been derived (e.g., RV20). Some further clarification would be beneficial.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for highlighting these flaws in the uncertainty assessment. Since this general comment\n\npoints towards specific concerns raised in RV20 and RV43, we have addressed it in detail through our responses to\n\nthose specific comments.\n\nRV4. Results: There is a general absence of quantified results which means that most conclusions need to be\n\ndraw from figures. This also applies to relationships between parameters (e.g., how SLA is related to waterline\n\nanomaly) which can only be qualitatively (and subjectively) draw from figures. A major issue for me is that al\nthough the authors stress the key role of wave forcing and storm impacts as a primary driver of coastal response\n\nthroughout the manuscript, they do not perform any relevant analysis. I strongly feel this is missing (please also\n\nrefer to comments RV16 to RV35).\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for highlighting this concern regarding the need for more quantitative analysis. In\n\nresponse, we have revised the manuscript to incorporate additional panels in existing figures, emphasizing statistical\n\nrelationships between seasonal cycles of key drivers (wave power and direction, and monthly-mean sea level) and\n\nwaterline positions, as well as between climate modes and waterline position anomalies. Furthermore, we have\n\nrevised Figure 2, 3 and 4 (now Figure 5), and we have added several new figures (Figure 4, S2-7) to strengthen\n\nthese points. That said, we would like to emphasize that qualitative analyses —such as those presented in Figure 5—\n\nalso provide valuable scientific insights, particularly when examining complex atmosphere-ocean-coast interactions\n\nthat are not easily captured through statistical approaches. Nonetheless, we have carefully addressed all specific\n\ncomments from RV16 to RV35 and have made substantial changes in the Results section to ensure that our findings\n\nare more robustly quantified and clearly supported throughout the manuscript.\n\nRV5. Discussion: I do not feel the authors discuss their findings and main claims appropriately in the context\n\nof the wider literature nor do they discuss the implications of their findings. Importantly, I do not feel the analysis\n\n5\n\npresented supports their main conclusions. The absence of adequate quantification of the results they discuss in\n\ncombination with the fact that they have not addressed wave forcing despite stressing its importance makes the\n\ndiscussion weak and often, unsupported (please also refer to comments RV36 to RV41).\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for raising this important concern regarding the discussion and contextualization of\n\nour findings. We acknowledge that the previous version of the manuscript lacked adequate discussion in the context\n\nof the broader literature, and we also agree that the implications of our findings were not sufficiently highlighted.\n\nIn response, we have significantly revised the Discussion section to address these concerns. The revised discussion\n\nnow includes a more thorough analysis of our results within the context of existing literature, highlighting both\n\nthe strengths and limitations of our study in comparison to previous works. We have reorganized the structure of\n\nthe Discussion to follow a more logical flow, with clearer connections between our results, existing literature, and\n\nperspectives for future work. We fully addressed specific comments RV36 to RV41 and the necessary revisions have\n\nbeen made to strengthen the manuscript’s overall argument.\n\nRV6. Conclusions: I feel the findings presented do not provide strong evidence for the main conclusions. Please\n\nrefer to comments RV42 and RV44 for specific details.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for raising this concern. We understand that the lack of strong evidence in the previous\n\nversion of the manuscript may have affected the robustness of the conclusions. In response, we have significantly\n\nrevised the Results and Discussion sections to provide more concrete evidence supporting our conclusions. By\n\nincluding additional analyses (e.g., signal-to-noise analysis for ENSO impact on waterline change, and correlations\n\nto quantify the strength of linear links between drivers and waterline position), clarifying key relationships, and\n\nenhancing the contextualization of our findings in the literature, we believe the revised manuscript now offers a\n\nmore compelling argument. We also totally rephrased the Conclusion section to ensure it accurately reflects the\n\nrevised content, and specifically in relation to the points raised in comments RV42 and RV44. These revisions\n\nstrengthen the connection between our results and the broader conclusions drawn from this study.\n\n**Specific Comments**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nRV7. L36-51: I understand where the authors are going with this paragraph. However, I feel there is some\n\nconfusion in the terminology with respect to coastal change indicators (see next comment below). There is some\n\nwell-established literature on the topic that is not considered here, so I would suggest revising the use of the term\n\n‘indicators’ within the framework of established literature.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this comment. We respond to this comment bellow comment RV8.\n\nRV8. L38-40: You are referring to coastal change indicators and although waterline is one such indicator ac\ncording to (Boak & Turner, 2005), dune erosion and beach slope are beach characteristics rather than coastal change\n\nindicators. The dune toe, vegetation line, any elevation-based beach contour for example can be coastal indicators,\n\nand therefore, changes in these can be considered as coastal change indicators. I would suggest rephrasing these\n\ntwo sentences to consistently refer to either coastal change indicators or beach parameters commonly monitored.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this comment. We understand the distinction made between coastal change indi\n6\n\ncators and beach characteristics. While we argue that beach slope, which typically flattens during erosional events\n\nand steepens during recovery, can serve as an indicator of coastal change, we acknowledge that it is more accurately\n\ndescribed as a beach characteristic. We have revised the corresponding lines, now mentioning only coastal indicators\n\n(lines 48-50).\n\nRV9. L49: By ‘one-line’ are you referring to 2D, linear indicators as opposed to area (e.g., subaerial beach) or\n\nvolume metrics?\n\nReviewer #2 is right, we wanted to refer to linear indicators (i.e., 2D) as opposed to area/volume metrics. The\n\nsentence is now phrased as \"generally through linear indicators (i.e. 2D)\" (line 59) in the revised manuscript.\n\nRV10. L50-51: I am not sure I understand this. SDS is based on the delineation of the land/water interface.\n\nThat really is the definition of the (instantaneous) waterline.\n\nThe land/sea interface can be ambiguous due to the dynamic nature of coastal sea level and hydrodynamic\n\nprocesses. In our manuscript, we distinguish between the shoreline, which refers to a morphological state and is\n\ntypically defined as the intersection between coastal topography and a fixed elevation (such as a tidal datum), and\n\nthe waterline, which is influenced by both hydrodynamic and morphodynamic factors. We have rephrased this\n\nsentence for improved clarity (lines 59-62).\n\nRV11. L60-64: please provide some relevant bibliography.\n\nThis part of the introduction have been substantially revised to reflect on the large body of literature studying\n\nshoreline variability (lines 70-86). It no longer opposes long-term and shorter terms shoreline variability, but rather\n\nexpose the various scales and mechanisms of change that can exhibit shoreline position.\n\nRV12. L71-L77: I feel the reader would benefit from a bit more explanation and detail as to i) what these\n\neffects are on the wave climate, and ii) Why and how are coasts and coastal ecosystems affected. This can then\n\nprovide the motivation for this study. At the moment I feel this paragraph is too general and vague to introduce\n\nthe reader to the topic and the value of this investigation. As a result, the motivation is not clear.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this suggestion. We have expanded this section to to clarify how ENSO variability\n\nimpacts wave climate and, in turn, coastal regions and ecosystems. We now introduce the distinct effects of EP\n\nand CP El Niño events on storm tracks and swell generation (Capotondi et al. 2015; Yeh et al. 2018; Taschetto et\n\nal. 2020; McKenna and Karemperidou 2024). We also clarify how these wave climate variations influence coastal\n\ndynamics: stronger and more frequent winter swells during EP El Niños result in enhanced coastal erosion (Allan\n\nand Komar 2006; Barnard et al. 2017; Boucharel et al. 2021), while CP El Niños tend to reduce storm activity in\n\nthe eastern Pacific and are associated with less marked coastal reponse. These distinctions now emphasize more\n\nclearly the need for a comprehensive investigation of how ENSO diversity shapes coastal change patterns along the\n\nNorth American West Coast (lines 87-114).\n\nRV13. L79: Why is this relevant? Almar 2023 may have investigated the influence of ENSO as the authors\n\nare, but other studies (apart from Almar 2023) exist that have performed regional analyses at higher spatial scales\n\n(e.g., Vos et al., 2023; Castelle et al., 2024; Warrick et al., 2025). Please provide a few words to also recognise that\n\nother large-scale studies have been performed at finer spatial scales and justify your choice of scale.\n\n7\n\nThis is a good point. We have completed it with references to other large-scale studies, such as Vos et al.\n(2023), Castelle et al. (2024), and Warrick et al. (2025), which perform analyses at finer spatial scales. (see revised\n\ntext in lines 115–120).\n\nRV14. Figure 1: Could you please indicate on the map where Long Beach, Monterey, Torrey Pines, and Playa\n\nel Suspiro are. Also, I feel this figure should appear later on in the results sections.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this comment. We have updated Figure 1 to indicate the locations of Long Beach\n\n(also relevant for Figure S3), Monterey, Torrey Pines, and Playa el Suspiro on the map (Figure 1, panel a). As\n\nFigure 1 shows the study area and presents the spatial diversity of significant wave height and sea-level variability\n\nalong the NAWC, we believe its place is in the Introduction, even if it displays the pie charts of waterline position\n\nlong-term trends which are indeed a result (but not further analyzed nor described in this study).\n\nRV15. L94-L98: Could you please provide some indicative figures (e.g., winter/summer Hs, Tp, etc)?\n\nCertainly, we detailed the description of regional coastal hydrodynamics (wave and sea-level) mean state and\n\nseasonal variability in the description of the subregions (lines 131-158).\n\n**Results**\n\nRV16. General: You provide acronyms for the four main regions but do not define them specifically. In the\n\ntext, you sometimes use the acronym and sometimes a description (e.g., southern California) but it is not always\n\nclear which are you are referring to. It would be beneficial to link the two (perhaps in the Figure 1 legend?) to\n\nincrease clarity.\n\nWe agree that the five subregions described in this study were not properly introduced. We added one para\ngraph of description for each in the Introduction (lines 131-158).\n\nRV17. General: You mention that changes in storm tracks and storminess are a critical factor behind the\n\ncoastal responses, but you provide not quantification of these and how they vary across the NAWC. Yet you do\n\nprove some very nice and detailed figures illustrating the impact of ENSO on SLA (-8.0 cm – 8.0 cm) and discuss\n\nthe waterline response to that. I am perplexed as to this disparity. If your findings indicate the coastal response\n\nto 16 cm SLA is more pronounced than its response to increased storminess and changes in storm tracks, please\n\nprovide some supporting evidence.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for raising this concern. Designing Figure 4 was challenging, as we aimed to present\n\nmultiple datasets on the same figure without making it too dense. We have now added contours of EKE 200 hPa for\n\nfixed values (100 to 250 m2/s2, with 25 m2/s2 intervals) to provide a clearer representation of storm track behavior\n\nacross different ENSO phases. This clearly shows clearly, both qualitatively and quantitatively, how storm tracks\n\nintensify and shift southwards during El Niño phases, associated by a wave power increase and rising sea-level.\n\nAs for the SLA impact, we moved this figure to the Supplementary and replaced it by a similar figure showing\n\nanomalies of wave power instead.\n\n8\n\nRV18. L101: Do you mean you average 125m either side of each transect?\n\nNo, in this sentence we referred to the 250m-spacing of the transects. We rephrased it in this way to remove\n\nany ambiguity (lines 166-167).\n\nRV19. L103: Good choice! It is great thinking that we have data since 1984 but in reality, the data we have\n\nprior to 2000 is so sparse it severely limits our analysis capability.\n\nWe appreciate that Reviewer #2 notes this point.\n\nRV20. L115: How was the 0.5m/year threshold calculated?\n\nWe are not sure we understand the question. If the question is about why the choice of 0.5 m/year as a\n\nthreshold to distinguish stable and non-stable beaches, we followed the methodology outlined by Luijendijk et al.\n\n(2018), who used the same threshold to define stability of a sandy beach, based on a reflection of the detection error\n\nand the study period.\n\nRV21. L126: It is not clear to me at least how the comparison between seasonal and overall signal was per\nformed.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for raising this point. To clarify, at each transect, we calculated the correlation and\n\np-value between the seasonal cycle (which was repeated to match the length of the raw signal) and the raw (monthly\nsampled) signal from which the seasonal cycle was derived. This allowed us to assess the statistical significance of\n\nthe seasonal component in relation to the overall variability of the raw signal. This has been slightly rephrased in\n\nthe revised manuscript (lines 196-198).\n\nRV22. Figure 2: This is a great plot that demonstrates the variability in the wave climate along the NAWC\n\nverry nicely. However, the latitude scales in (a) and (b-e) do not match so it is difficult to make direct comparisons.\nPlease align the two y-axis. Also, please clarify ‘Cycle range’ in (a) refers to waterline excursion.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for the positive feedback on Figure 2. About the alignment of the latitude scales in\n\npanels (a) and (b–e), we acknowledge the concern. As noted in our response to Reviewer #1, the y-axis in panels\n\n(b–e) represents the latitudes of individual transects, which are sorted by latitude. Since the transects are not\n\nuniformly distributed along the coastline, and because the study area is not a perfectly straight, west-facing coast,\n\nthe y-axis spacing is uneven. Aligning the y-axes to match panel (a) would require to average data over latitude\n\nranges or distorting the relative size of the transects, which could undermine the spatial representation. We believe\n\nthe current layout better reflects the spatial variability of the displayed metrics, even if it is slightly less legible.\n\nWe added horizontal black lines between subregions on panels b-e to help readers situating the presented seaonal\n\ncycles. We changed ’Cycle range’ into ’Seasonal waterline excursion\".\n\nRV23. L145-150: I can see in Figure 2a that there is a significant drop in wave power south of 34°N accompanied\n\nby an equally significant difference in wave direction (Figure 2c) and a noticeable shift in the timing and magnitude\n\nof negative SLA (Figure 2d). But the switch in the timing of the erosion/accretion cycle seems to happen much\n\nfurther south, below 28°N and does not look like it could be associated with the timing of the SL seasonal cycle\n\nthat switches much further north, at least as shown in Figure 2. Are you referring to some previous work that has\n\n9\n\nlinked the two? Also, it seems to me that below 25°N the shoreline orientation is more southward (Fig2a) and the\n\nprevailing wave direction (Fig2c) so wave incidence is more oblique. There also seems to be a definite shift in wave\n\npower seasonality with lower wave power during the winter months and higher during the summer months. So very\n\nplausibly, the shift in the waterline circle may reflect the aforementioned conditions rather than a 7-25cm SLA.\n\nThis is a fair point that deserves some explanations from our part. Southern SCA and BCS coastlines share\n\nsimilar characteristics : they are roughly southwest oriented, have a weak and no spatially-coherent wave power\n\nseasonal cycle, similar wave direction and sea-level seasonal cycles. However they exhibit very different waterline\n\nposition seasonal cycles, southern SCA is very impacted by its local geomorphic characteristics ( *Warrick et al.,*\n\n*2025* ) and therefore show no regional consistency in its waterline position, making it hard to associate its regional\n\nvariability with any drivers. However BCS waterline positions are spatially very consistent at the seasonal scale,\n\nand this seasonal pattern is more correlated to fluctuations of the sea-level (see new panel f on Figure 2) than to\n\nwave power/direction variability. Variations of „ 20 cm in the sea-level induce passive waterline change of a few\n\nmeters (2.5-3 m considering the median estimated slope along the NAWC *tanβ* „ 0 *.* 07, see Figure S12), which is\n\nalready relatively large regarding the 9 m median seasonal excursion in BCS, and to which can also be expected\n\nnon-passive changes, adding further weight to the influence of sea-level variations on the waterline position. How\never, this discussion has no place in the Results section and has been moved to the Discussion (lines 369-386)\n\nRV24. L162-163 & Fig3: I will return to my earlier comment (RV12) that not enough information on the be\nhaviour and influence of ENSO on the wave climate has been provided and as a result. Please include the relevant\n\nbackground info in the introduction.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this comment. This has been added to the Introduction section (lines 87-114).\n\nRV25. L163: The PDO is not introduced until L176. Please introduce in the first instance. Also, please\n\nintroduce it in the introduction and discuss interactions with ENSO.\n\nWe no longer refer to PDO in the Results section, nor in the Introduction. We now only reflect on the potential\ninfluence of PDO and waterline variability along the NAWC in the Discussion section, with proper description of\n\nthe phenomenon (lines 427-435).\n\nRV26. L178-180: I am not sure I understand why you characterise your ‘time coverage’ as limited. Are you\n\nreferring to the 1997-2021 period? If yes, I am guessing existing knowledge indicates the PDO has larger cycles?\n\nAgain, this is not at all clear primarily because the background information is missing in the introduction.\n\nSimilarly to the previous response, we shifted this reflection on PDO impacts to the Discussion. We were in\ndeed mentioning that our time coverage (1997-2022) was relatively short compared to PDO return period, making\n\nanalysis complicated. The 20-30 years return period of the PDO is now clearly described (lines 427-435).\n\nRV27. L174-182: Perhaps I am missing something, but I feel this is more of a discussion than the presentation\n\nof your results. Because of the lack of adequate information on the behaviour of ENSO and its influence on the\n\nregional wave climates, and (complete absence of info on) the PDO, these statements are not supported here. I am\n\nalso not sure I can see the notably less pronounced influence of ENSO on PNW and NCA. For example, despite\n\nthe admittedly much greater variability in the waterline anomaly in PNW, both PNW and NCA plots show a drop\n\nin the 2010 event followed by a steady increase up to 2016 and another large drop in 2016. This behaviour is very\n\n10\n\nclosely mirrored by CP in panel (g), at least visually. Some quantitative results are necessary.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this insightful comment. We agree that the initial presentation of this analysis\n\nlacked clarity, especially regarding the lack of introduction of climate modes and their influence on regional wave\n\nclimates. We intended to highlight that waterline changes in the PNW and NCA appeared to follow long-term\n\npatterns, distinct from the more event-driven erosional responses observed in SCA, BC, and BCS during El Niño\n\nevents. You are correct that the impact of El Niño events, particularly in 2010 and 2016, is evident in the waterline\n\nanomaly plots for the PNW and NCA, but these event-driven changes seem to be superimposed on longer-term\n\nvariability patterns. This is likely why the waterline anomalies in these regions did not show a substantial dip\n\nbelow zero despite the occurrence of these El Niño events. To reflect on ENSO-driven changes we modified our\n\nmethodology (Figure 4 and 5) to now consider changes of waterline position anomalies between summer and win\nter, allowing us to quantify ENSO related changes despite the longer-terms waterline position anomaly variability\n\nobserved along the PNW and NCA. To address the concern regarding the absence of quantitative results, we have\n\nadded to Figure 3 a heatmap showing the correlations between climate modes and regional waterline anomalies.\n\nThis provides a clearer, more quantitative understanding of the relationships between the climate modes and the\n\nobserved regional variability. We have revised the corresponding paragraph in the manuscript (lines 265-269) to\n\nmore accurately describe our results, and further discuss the implications in the Discussion section (lines 395-400).\n\nRV28. L188 The PMM has also not been introduced or discussed thus far. Please provide the necessary back\nground information on the relevant climatic patterns in your introduction.\n\nThe PMM is now only mentioned in the Discussion as an existing mode of climate variability in the Pacific\n\n(lines 427-429)\n\nRV29. L183-190 Whether a correlation is positive or negative has no effect on its strength or statistical sig\nnificance. Here you characterise a correlation as ‘weak yet positive’. I imagine ‘anti-correlations’ refer to negative\n\ncorrelations? Also, you are characterising similar values differently, sometimes referring to correlations in the order\n\nof 0.4 as weak (e.g., L196) and sometimes not. Lastly, please clarify if you are reporting R (Pearson or Spearman?)\nvalues and what level of statistical significance you are considering prior to reporting your findings.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for raising this point. We have removed ’yet positive’ from the sentence, turned ’anti\ncorrelations’ to ’negative correlations’ and standardized our terminology: correlations are now consistently referred\n\nto as strong (0 *.* 7 ă | *R* | ă 1), moderate (0 *.* 3 ă | *R* | ă 0 *.* 7) or weak (| *R* | ă 0 *.* 3). We also clarified that the reported\n\ncorrelations are Pearson correlation coefficients (lines 228-229) and significance levels are now described when cor\nrelation are mentioned. In figures, correlation with a 1% and 5% significance levels are now marked with \"**\" or \"*\",\n\nrespectively. Figure S2 from the previous draft of the Supplementary has been removed. Panel g in Figure 3 shows\n\nthe Pearson correlation between climate modes and regionally-averaged waterline anomalies between 1997-2022.\n\nRV30. L196-2001: How do the two phases of ENSO relate to or are expressed in CP and EP? This should also\n\nbe mentioned in the introduction.\n\nIt’s a good point, and further supports the need to clarify the description of climate modes in the introduction\n\nto the paper. This question was partially answered by the definition of El Niño/La Niña phases in the Methods,\n\nwhile we acknowledge it was not the best place for it. The revised Introduction now introduced clearly the climate\n\nmodes and indices used to quantify their intensity. We added a long description of ENSO diversity within the\n\n11\n\nEP/CP continuum (lines 101-109)\n\nRV31. L202-220: (please also refer to comment RV17). You mention that changes in storm tracks and stormi\nness are a critical factor behind the coastal responses, but you provide not quantification of these and how they\n\nvary across the NAWC. The discussion you have included may be correct, but you provide the reader with no\n\nevidence, other than the waterline response shown in Fig4, of the forcing conditions during these events and how\n\nthey change. You use the EKE as a proxy for quantifying changes in storminess and show the contours on Fig4,\n\nbut you provide no quantification of how these relate to ‘. . . significant changes in coastal wave extremes.’ Please\n\nprovide some information and a figure to demonstrate the spatial distribution as they should be at least if not more\n\nimportant than the SLA shown in Fig4.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for pointing this out. As explained in the response to RV17, we revised Figure 4 (now\n\nFigure 5) to include contours of EKE with fixed values for each ENSO phase. This now clearly shows that storm\n\ntracks intensify and shift southward during El Niño, leading to increased storm activity, both offshore and along\n\ncoastal areas, from Southern California to Southern Baja California, associated with increased wave power. We\n\nrewrote the description of Figure 5 (former Figure 4) accordingly (334-354)\n\nRV32. L204: typo: remove full stop after the word ‘phase’.\n\nGood catch. Thank you for raising it.\n\nRV33. L202-228: A large part of this section discusses the influence of ENSO on the wave climate. This should\n\nbe part of your introduction, not your results. This is what will set the scene for your waterline analysis.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this comment. Most elements of this section have been incorporated to the In\ntroduction (lines 87-114), and we rewrote this part of the Results section to add some quantitative figures (lines\n\n312-320).\n\nRV34. L216: you have already introduced EP and CP; there is no need to repeat here.\n\nRight. We thank Reviewer #2 for raising this point. The repetition has been removed.\n\nRV35. L220-241: this is more of a discussion section.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for pointing out the ambiguity in the structure of the paper. This paragraph indeed\n\ncombined factual observations with subjective interpretations and discussion points. We revised the paragraph to\n\nfocus on the factual results only and moved the interpretive elements to the discussion section, where they fit more\n\nappropriately (lines 407–426).\n\n**Discussion**\n\nRV36. General: I am missing a discussion on how your findings compare with the findings of previous works.\n\nI am not an expert in your area, however, I am aware of at least on publication you also cite (Vos 2023). How do\n\nyour results compare with theirs? Why do you think there are differences if these exists? Are your findings in line\n\nwith current understanding of how this stretch of coastline has evolved? If not, what new have we learnt?\n\n12\n\nThe revised Discussion now discuss our results in the context of existing litterature. The 3 first paragraphs\n\n(lines 359-406) mention common observations made with other studies, both locally and regionally. Globally our\n\nobservations align with existing literature but with analysis performed at an intermediate scale, between local stud\nies and continental ones, refining our understanding of the spatial diversity of seasons- and ENSO-related waterline\n\nchange.\n\nRV37. General: I am also missing a discussion on the implications of your findings. Are there any observed\n\ntrends in ENSO? If yes, how do you think the NAWC might be affected in the future?\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for raising this point. We added a paragraph on the implication of understanding\n\nclimate-driven to improve our prediction skills in terms of coastal vulnerability, including a mention to the potential\n\ninfluence of climate change on climate modes, further complication our understanding of climate-related morpho\ndynamics (lines 427-445).\n\nRV38. L265-270: Here you partially address my comments RV17 and RV31. Yet throughout your manuscript\n\nyou refer to the influence of ENSO on storminess. I have a few comments relating to this: I. Several studies have\n\ndemonstrated storm links between ENSO and wave conditions as you also indicate (e.g., L265-266). Do you have an\n\nexplanation why in your case you did not find any? II. Could you please indicate the location of ERA5 node you used\n\nfor the comparison shown in Figure S3? III. The absence of statistically significant correlations between wave power\n\nand ENSO (in one location) does not imply the absence of a relationship between wave power and waterline response.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for these 3 points. We think there is a misunderstanding here because our point was\n\nnot robustly stated. While we agree that there are links between ENSO and wave conditions, these links are not\n\nsystematically linear. We revised Figure S3 to show the winter response of wave power to ENSO for the 4 locations\n\nshown in Figure 1 (same ERA5 node, for convenience). Among the four sites, only Long Beach (PNW) shows a\n\nnon-significant correlation between MEI and winter-averaged wave power. However, we make two observations on\n\nthe correlations:\n\n1. The response to MEI variations is not significant (p-value < 0.05) for the four sites if the two main ENSO\n\nevents (MEI > 1.5: 1997/1998 and 2015/2016) are removed. This suggests that wave power is mostly sensitive\n\nto strong El Niños, at least for the three southern sites (there is seemingly a different behaviour along the\n\nPNW).\n\n2. The strong La Niña event of 1998/1999 is associated with the highest wave power between 1997-2022 at Long\n\nBeach (documented by Komar et al. (2001) for the PNW), which runs counter to the simple narrative of a\n\nlinear link between ENSO and wave power.\n\nAlso, we did not mean to imply a lack of relationship between wave power and waterline response. The para\ngraph have been rephrased to incorporate the aforementioned discussion, and to remove potential ambiguity on\n\nlinks between wave and waterline variability (lines 417-426).\n\nRV39. I am not surprised you find weak and mostly not statistically significant relationships between ENSO\n\nand coastal response as your finding also agrees with previous work. However, with this you have, at least partially,\n\ndisproved your hypothesis as stated in L155-158. You stress the key role of wave forcing and storm impacts as a\n\nprimary driver of coastal response throughout your manuscript, yet you do not perform any relevant analysis. I\n\n13\n\nstrongly feel this is missing.\n\nWe acknowledge that the weak linear relationships we found between ENSO and coastal response are consistent\n\nwith previous studies. However, we believe this does not disprove our hypothesis, but rather highlights a lack of\n\nlinear relationship. In the revised manuscript, we now show direct correlations between climate modes (including\n\nENSO) and regionally averaged waterline responses (Figure 3). While the correlations are statistically significant,\n\nthey are generally weak (| *R* | ă 0 *.* 48), which is, again, expected given the complexity of the relationships between\n\nthese climate modes and coastal responses. We added Figure 4 in the main manuscript to show that El Niño (and\n\nto a smaller extent, La Niña) lead to changes of waterline position anomalies that are visible despite the noisiness of\n\nwaterline position data (due to spatial heterogeneity of and SDW limited accuracy). Additionally, we have updated\n\nFigure 5 to clearly illustrate the increase in storm track activity and its southward shift during El Niño events.\n\nOverall, we maintain that these results are valuable for understanding the broader dynamics at play. The revised\n\nmanuscript includes these clarifications to provide a more nuanced interpretation of our findings.\n\nRV40. L267: This is the first mention of MEI. Please include and explain earlier in the manuscript.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for pointing this out. MEI is now introduced earlier in the Introduction alongside the\n\nother climate modes considered in this study (lines 96–99).\n\nRV41. L293-297: you mention the importance of the combined impact of elevated water level and storm impact,\n\nyet miss the opportunity to demonstrate this at monthly, seasonal, or annual timeframes. Though it is possible you\n\nfind equally weak relationships due to the inherent noisiness of SDS and (potentially) the quality of the wave data,\n\nI feel that without this analysis.\n\nThis is a good point that supports the general remark on the lack of statistics quantifying links between drivers\n\nand shoreline change in this paper. As mentioned in the response to previous comments, statistical links between\n\nclimate mode and shoreline change raise limitations that we partially confront and/or discuss in the revised version of the manuscript (see responses to comments R31 and R39). For the seasonal aspect, we added to Figure\n\n2 the statistical links between coastal hydrodynamics and shoreline change at the seasonal scale, we also added\n\nthe description of these results (lines 228-236). Regarding the storm impact, we found it rather complicating to\n\ntranslate it into quantitative analysis beyond the display of ENSO-induced storm track variability in Figure 5 as\n\nstorm influence can be local and distant, especially when considering waves. In this revised manuscript our analysis\n\nrelies more heavily on wave power as a direct driver of coastal change rather than storms.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nRV42. L318-321: I am perplexed at this statement as your findings indicate weak and mostly not statistically\n\nsignificant relationships between climatic patterns and coastal response and you have not shown any quantitative\n\nresults relating wave energy to coastal response. Including a plot of wave power in Fig2b, in my view is not sufficient\n\nto support this conclusion.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this comment, in line with comments above. We totally rewrote our conclusion,\n\nwhich is now more precise and directly points towards key results supported by correlations, a SNR anaylsis and\n\ncomposites of the different ENSO phases.\n\n14\n\nRV43. L456-474: Given the accuracy of the method as reported by Bergma 2024 ( 10m), would these results\n\nnot indicate that most of the observed variability is within the uncertainty f the method, i.e., noise?\n\nThis is a relevant point that deserves more explanation. A priori, SDW/SDS noise is not time-dependent.\n\nTherefore, by aggregating values using monthly resampling and estimating the seasonal cycle based on over 20\n\nyears of monthly-sampled data, the magnitude of SDS noise is minimized in the estimates of the seasonal cycle\n\n(similar reasoning behind the analysis of Warrick et al. (2025)). However, for demonstration purposes, we have\n\nadded to Figure S9 the validation of the seasonal cycle for 4 profiles at Torrey Pines, CA, and at one profile at En\nsenada, Mexico. The low error (standard error *σ* = 3.2-6.9 m, below the „ 10 m SDS noise) between the estimated\n\nand observed seasonal cycle further supports our approach (lines 543-549).\n\nRV44. L332-335: you have shown the 200hPa isobars in Fig4 and explain you are using EKE as a proxy for\n\nchanges in storm track but do not perform any analysis to support this statement. As a matter of fact, the southern\n\ntip of the Baja peninsula shows the largest negative (erosion) anomaly in Fig4a, d, and e and this does not seem to\n\nrelate to changes in storm track.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for pointing this out. This is now properly described and justified in the Introduction\n\nsection, drawing on relevant literature (lines 94-106). Regarding Figure 5 (former Figure 4), we acknowledge that\n\nthe use of the 25th percentile contour for storm tracks can be misleading. The example of the southernmost tip of\n\nBaja California, which falls outside this contour yet experiences significant erosion, illustrates this issue and raise\n\ndoubts about our hypothesis that storm tracks, by influencing regional wave climate, can be a proxy of waterline\n\nchange. Initially, the 25th percentile contour was chosen because it provided a simple and clear way to represent\n\nthe shift in storm track position without overcrowding the figure. In the revised version of the figure, we have\n\nreplaced the percentile-based contour with several specific EKE value contours, which more accurately highlight\n\nthe southward shift of storm tracks during El Niño events. This addition includes quantitative values to better\n\nexplain why regions like the southern tip of Baja California are exposed to storm tracks despite not being within\n\nthe 25th percentile contour. Also offshore storms lead to the generation of waves offshore, which can expose a given\n\ncoastal area to an enhanced wave climate without directly experiencing the storm.\n\n**Methods**\n\nRV45. L337: typo: ‘methods’\n\nGood catch ! We corrected this.\n\nRV46. L338: typo: replace ‘it consists in a. . . ’ with: ‘it consists of a. . . ’ however, the use of this expression is\n\nnot a good use of the English language in this case.\n\nWe rephrased this sentence to : \"it involves combining different spectral bands to produce SCoWI images\"\n\n(lines 483-485).\n\nRV47. L341: Who validate the application to the Landsat series? If I am not mistaken, Bergsma 2024 mention\n\nthat validation of the application of their method to the Landsat series imagery would constitute further work.\n\nThis is an important point, we thank Reviewer #2 for pointing it out. As the transferability of the method\n\n15\n\nto Landsat imagery has not yet been validated in the literature, we have revised Figure S9 to include separate\n\nvalidation metrics of the satellite-derived data at Torrey Pines (validation data spanning between 2001-2017, so\nonly slightly overlapping with the Sentinel-2 mission) and at Ensenada, Mexico. These are shown as separated\n\nstandard errors: *σ* *S* 2 for Sentinel-2 and *σ* *Landsat* for Landsat, showing strong agreement between the performances\n\nof satellite-derived waterline estimations from Sentinel-2 and Landsat missions. We now describe this transferability\n\ncheck in the Methods section of the revised manuscript (lines 542-548).\n\nRV48. L345: I believe Bergsma 2024 used the cirrus band and cloud mask in S2 to filter out cloud-contaminated\n\nimages. If the SCoWI method is part of your work (or of others) please clarify and/or reference accordingly)\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this comment. Bergsma et al. (2024) used the S2 cirrus band to mask the de\ntected clouds within images, not to discard entire images from the waterline detection process. Our approach differs\n\nslightly, as we apply a filtering method to both Sentinel-2 and Landsat images to remove cloud-contaminated images\n\nentirely. This filter is part of our work and has now been mentionned in the Methods section (lines 492-493) and\n\nfurther described in the Supplementary Materials (Figure S11).\n\nRV49. L347: Highlighting the poor use of the expression: ‘thanks to. . . ’ in this case.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for pointing out this poor phrasing. We totally rephrased this sentence, as detailed in\n\nthe response to your next comment.\n\nRV50. L347-348: One thing is defining the threshold using a refined Otsu approach, and another is deriving\n\nthe waterline contour using a matching squares algorithm. This is not clear in the text at the moment.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for this comment. The process of detecting the waterline from a SCoWI image involves\n\ntwo key steps: first, the definition of the threshold using a refined Otsu approach, and second, the delineation of\n\nthe waterline contour based on this threshold using a marching squares algorithm. We have rephrased the sentence\n\nto clearly differentiate these two steps (lines 493-496).\n\nRV51. L349: GHSSH not defined\n\nGood catch ! GHSSH was indeed not associated with a reference. We fixed this issue (lines 497-498).\n\nRV52. L348-350: Please be consistent with the use of tense. E.g., ‘..waterlines are then. . . ’ and ‘. . . constituted. . . ’.\n\nPlease check consistency throughout the manuscript.\n\nThis is an good point, thank you. We revised the manuscript to ensure consistency in tense usage throughout\n\nthe text.\n\nRV53. L355: typos: ‘the time series. . . ’ & ‘positions’. Please check the use of singular instead of plural when\n\nreferring to waterline positions throughout the manuscript.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #2 for pointing this out. We corrected this typo and ensured consistent use of singular\n\nand plural forms throughout the manuscript.\n\n16\n\nRV54. L345-359: Please rephrase this sentence. I know what you are saying is that at each time step, you ap\nplied a tidal correction based on the estimated tidal elevation and the mean transect slope using linear translation,\n\nbut this section is poorly written and rather convoluted.\n\nWe rephrased the paragraph to clarify the description of the tidal correction process (lines 503-509). The term\n\n\"Tide-induced horizontal displacement of the waterline\" which was unnecessarily wordy, has been replaced by \"Tide\n\ncorrection term\" for improved readability and conciseness.\n\nRV55. L359: several studies have demonstrated that including run-up corrections is critical at low gradient\n\nsites. Figrue S7 suggests that a large proportion of the NAWC sites are dissipative, yet you are not including runup\n\ncorrections. Given this area is rich in data both measured and high-quality modelled data, could you provide some\n\njustification/explanation of your choice? How do you think this might (or not) influence your results?\n\nThis is an interesting remark. Our approach is justified by 2 main reasons. 1) Wave runup corrections for\n\nsatellite-derived data are usually wave setup corrections (as solving the runup phase it out of reach) derived from\n\nempirical wave setup correction formula like *Stockdon et al. (2006)* . While this type of formula have locally proven\n\ngood results in reducing errors associated with remotely sensed shoreline positions, several recent studies (e.g.,\n\n*Toomey et al., 2024* ) point out that the systematic use of empirical formula to estimate wave setup over large scale\n\ncan lead to erroneous results, especially when wave setup/runup is calculated from coarse datasets like the one\n\nused in our study. 2) Wave setup-induced variations of the sea-level at the coast are influenced by climate patterns\n\nsuch as the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of wave climate and are therefore part of the climate-driven\n\nwaterline variability we are exploring in this study. This relates to point RV10 on distinguishing between SDW\n\nand SDS: non-astronomical coastal water level fluctuations are an integral part of the SDW signal we analyze. And\n\n(this is a second order argument) we also note that wave setup corrections made in several studies (e.g., *Vos et al.,*\n\n*2023b* ; *Graffin et al., 2023* ) do not affect significantly standard error, which is the most relevant metric to minimize\n\nwhen studying waterline/shoreline variability.\n\nRV56. L363-366: It is good to see that someone has considered the differences between satellite missions!\n\nWe appreciate that Reviewer #2 find this methodological point relevant !\n\nRV57. L388: Most studies use 100-150m-spaced transects (Mao et al., 2021; Castelle et al., 2022; Vos et\n\nal., 2023), and this is still often not dense enough especially for small pocket beaches. Could you please explain\n\nwhy you chose to use a wider transect spacing especially as the NAWC coastline also includes many pocket beaches?\n\nThe choice of a 250 m transect spacing was a deliberate trade-off between achieving a sufficiently detailed\n\nresolution and managing the computational cost of a study at this continental scale. While we acknowledge that\n\na 250 m spacing might under-represent small pocket beaches—many of which are indeed present along the NAWC\n\ncoastline—we considered that capturing regional-scale patterns of shoreline change was the primary objective of\n\nthis study.\n\nRV58. L402: ‘. . . the average value of the signal. . . ’ please clarify what you are referring to for the benefit of\n\nthe reader.\n\nWe rephrased the corresponding sentence : \"as the average of the monthly-sampled detrended waterline posi\n17\n\ntions, noted *X* *wm* *[d]* \" (line 556-557).\n\nRV59. L403: please clarify what Xw and Xtrend are for the benefit of the reader.\n\nWe rephrased the corresponding sentence : \"where *X* *w* is the waterline position time series, *X* *trend* the linear\n\ncomponent of waterline change derived from *X* *w*, and *X* *w* *[d]* [“] *[ X]* *[w]* [´] *[ X]* *[trend]* [the detrended waterline position.] *[ N]* *[m]* [is]\n\n...\" (lines 558-560).\n\nRV60. L421-423: If storm track and storm wave intensity are parameters of interest as stated in L89-90 but\n\nalso throughout the manuscript, why not use some more direct measure of these? If not, please provide some link\n\nbetween them and the EKE.\n\nSee response to RV2.\n\n**Supplementary**\n\nRV61. Figure S3: please indicate the location of the Columbia River Littoral Cell somewhere.\n\nThank you for this suggestion. We have updated Figure 1 to indicate the location of Long Beach, which is part\n\nof the Columbia River Littoral Cell. Additionally, in Figure S3 (now Figure S8), we replaced the mention of the\n\nColumbia River Littoral Cell with Long Beach for consistency and clarity. This should help readers better locate\n\nthe site.\n\nRV62. Figure S5: please provide a legend for the colour scale used in b-e. What does the colour represent?\n\nGood catch! We added a color legend to Figure S5 (now Figure S10) to clarify the values and meaning of the\n\ncolor scale, which represents the density of points in panels (b–e). This addition ensures the figure is self-explanatory.\n\n**References**\n\nBoak, E. H. & Turner, I. L. (2005) ’Shoreline definition and detection: A review’.

In this document, we address/clarify the remaining points raised by Reviewer #1. Please note that\n\nthe reviewers’ comments and questions are shown in black, and our responses are shown in blue .\n### **Reviewer #1**\n\nLines 121–148: The lateral boundaries of the PNW, NCA, and other study areas are not clearly defined in\n\nclimatological or geomorphological terms. In Figure 1, the rationale for using a rectangular boundary is unclear.\n\nIf waterlines are the primary focus, offshore and nearshore limits might be more appropriately defined by features\n\nsuch as the dune front or depth of closure. The geomorphic processes influencing responses to ENSO are not well\n\narticulated. Were any additional studies conducted to confirm that parameters such as beach slope, substrate\n\nlithology, or riverine sediment inputs do not significantly affect waterline positions on a seasonal scale? These\n\nfactors appear to be omitted from the seasonal discussion in Figure 2. While this version addresses the points\n\nraised in my previous review, incorporating considerations beyond statistical projections—such as relevant physical\n\nprocesses—could enhance the study’s rigor and its appeal to an international audience.\n\nWe thank Reviewer #1 for these general comments.\n\nAs mentioned in our previous responses, the subdivision of the coastline into subregions was based on a combi\nnation of geophysical and practical considerations. These include wave climate considerations, as well as the need\n\nto ensure a relatively balanced number of transects per subregion. We have slighlty deepened the description of\n\nthe subregions to mention additional geomorphological and/or climatological characteristics of each subregion. For\n\nexample : \"Also, the PNW is situated along the Cascadia Subduction Zone, exposing the area to hazards associated\n\nwith active tectonics\". Regarding the rectangular boundaries shown in Figure 1, they are intended solely to delineate\n\nthe subregions and should not be interpreted as defining the offshore or nearshore extents of the coastal system.\n\nThis is now outlined in the caption of the figure. We agree with Reviewer #1 that depth of closure and dune front\n\nare appropriate coastal features to define the boundaries of the beach system. Flatter beaches are expected to\n\nbe more sensitive to seasonal and interannual sea-level fluctuations compared to steeper ones. Similarly, lithology\n\nmight play a role in the extent of the morphological response to a given forcing. However there is no evidence, to our\n\nknowledge, that these factors alter the timing of morphological response to the forcing, or at least not consistently\n\nat the regional (and at larger) scale, which is the focus of the study. Riverine sediment supply is more complex:\n\nwhile liquid discharge often shows a seasonal pattern, the solid discharge that impacts coastal morphology tends\n\nto be dominated by episodic flood events with multi-year return periods ( *Warrick et al., 2022* ; *Barnard & War-*\n\n*rick, 2010* ). Moreover, the influence of fluvial sediment input varies spatially, largely depending on proximity to\n\nriver mouths. We expanded the Discussion section to discuss the influence sediment supply on waterline variability :\n\n\"Additionally, an overlooked aspect of climate-driven waterline variability is the influence of riverine sediment\n\nsupply. While the influence of riverine sediment supply on waterline variability is undoubtedly an important factor,\n\nits detailed assessment remains largely out of reach with current tools and data, especially at the seasonal scale. Solid\n\nsediment input that drives coastal morphological changes is typically linked to infrequent, localized, high-magnitude\n\nflood events with multi-year return periods ( *Barnard & Warrick, 2010* ; *Warrick et al., 2023* ).\"\n\n1\n\n### **Reviewer #2**\n\nI would like to commend the authors for their efforts and attention to detail in their responses to reviewers’\n\ncomments. The authors have clearly spent a lot of time addressing and integrating extensive reviewer comments\n\ninto their manuscript, and I hope they feel that their efforts have resulted in a significantly improved manuscript.\n\nTheir revised manuscript they have made substantial changes, including extensively restructuring the original\n\nmanuscript, incorporating additional background information and reference to relevant literature, and providing\n\nadditional quantitative results. Their work addresses some long standing and highly relevant questions in the field\n\nof coastal dynamics the relevance and importance of which is now clear and well supported. The authors also now\n\nhighlighted some of the key novelties of their study which, in my view, were previously understated. Overall, I find\n\nthis is a manuscript of very high quality that represents a significant contribution in the field. In my view, it is\n\nready for publication, and I am looking forward to seeing it published in due course.\n\nKat Konstantinou.\n\nWe thank Kat Konstantinou for this feedback as well as for the very constructive and complete review she\n\nprovided. We believe it significantly helped us improving the quality of the manuscript.\n\n2\n\n### **Review of the manuscript titled Waterline responses to climate forcing along ** ***the North American West Coast*** **SUMMARY & GENERAL COMMENTS **\n\nThis work addresses some long standing and highly relevant questions in the field of coastal\ndynamics that has only been made possible in recent years thanks to the rapid increase in satellitebased shoreline extraction capabilities. The authors apply a recently developed method for\nextracting waterlines from optical satellite imagery to investigate the relationship between large\nscale climatic forcing and coastal response along the western coast of the US. They derive monthly\ntimeseries of waterline positions along 7000+ ~250m-spaced transects and analyse the monthly and\nseasonal signals alongside monthly wave power, wave direction, and sea level data. Their findings\nindicate spatially variable coastal response across the region that mirrors difference in incident wave\npower and wave direction as well as sea level. The authors hypothesise that climate modes are most\nlikely the key drivers of a large portion of the observed variability in waterline position and perform\nstatistical analysis of the waterline position anomalies and different expressions of ENSO. This\nanalysis leads to only weak and mostly statistically not significant relationships.\n\nThe manuscript could benefit from a stronger statement as to the nuance of the work and findings\npresented, however, my main comments are as follow:\n\nRV1. **Structure** : The introduction does not provide the necessary background information although\n\nmost of this is present in the results and discussion sections. The are also several sections in\nthe results section that would be more appropriately included in the discussion section.\nTherefore, I would suggest restructuring the manuscript so that the introduction includes all\nthe necessary background information, the results section includes the presentation of results,\nand the discussion section only includes a critical analysis/interpretation of the findings.\nSeveral suggestions have been made in the specific comments that follow.\n\nRV2. **Methods** : the methods are clear. However, it is not always clear which approaches the authors\n\nhave adopted from previous works and which they are contributing to this work. Also, they do\nnot provide much explanation as to why the authors use the Eddy kinetic wind energy as a\nproxy for storm track direction instead of the parameters of interest, i.e., storm wave intensity\nand direction. It would also be useful to provide some link between storm wave parameters of\ninterest and the EKE.\n\nRV3. **Uncertainty** : The authors consider various sources of error and uncertainty yet in some cases,\n\nit is not clear how uncertainty is incorporated in the results (e.g., RV43). In other cases, it is not\nclear how some uncertainty limits have been derived (e.g., RV20). Some further clarification\nwould be beneficial.\n\nRV4. **Results** : There is a general absence of quantified results which means that most conclusions\n\nneed to be draw from figures. This also applies to relationships between parameters (e.g., how\nSLA is related to waterline anomaly) which can only be qualitatively (and subjectively) draw\nfrom figures. A major issue for me is that although the authors stress the key role of wave\nforcing and storm impacts as a primary driver of coastal response throughout the manuscript,\n\nthey do not perform any relevant analysis. I strongly feel this is missing (please also refer to\ncomments RV16 to RV35).\n\nRV5. **Discussion** : I do not feel the authors discuss their findings and main claims appropriately in the\n\ncontext of the wider literature nor do they discuss the implications of their findings.\nImportantly, I do not feel the analysis presented supports their main conclusions. The absence\nof adequate quantification of the results they discuss in combination with the fact that they\nhave not addressed wave forcing despite stressing its importance makes the discussion weak\nand often, unsupported (please also refer to comments RV36 to RV41).\n\nRV6. **Conclusions** : I feel the findings resented do not provide strong evidence for the main\n\nconclusions. Please refer to comments RV42 and RV44 for specific details.\n### **SPECIFIC COMMENTS **\n## **1. Introduction **\n\nRV7. L36-51: I understand where the authors are going with this paragraph. However, I feel there is\n\nsome confusion in the terminology with respect to coastal change indicators (see next\n\ncomment below). There is some well-established literature on the topic that is not considered\n\nhere, so I would suggest revising the use of the term ‘indicators’ within the framework of\nestablished literature.\n\nRV8. L38-40: You are referring to coastal change indicators and although waterline is one such\n\nindicator according to (Boak & Turner, 2005), dune erosion and beach slope are beach\ncharacteristics rather than coastal change indicators. The dune toe, vegetation line, any\nelevation-based beach contour for example can be coastal indicators, and therefore, changes\nin these can be considered as coastal change indicators. I would suggest rephrasing these two\n\nsentences to consistently refer to either coastal change indicators or beach parameters\ncommonly monitored.\n\nRV9. L49: By ‘one-line’ are you referring to 2D, linear indicators as opposed to area (e.g., subaerial\n\nbeach) or volume metrics?\n\nRV10. L50-51: I am not sure I understand this. SDS is based on the delineation of the land/water\n\ninterface. That really is the definition of the (instantaneous) waterline.\n\nRV11. L60-64: please provide some relevant bibliography\n\nRV12. L71-L77: I feel the reader would benefit from a bit more explanation and detail as to i) what\n\nthese effects are on the wave climate, and ii) Why and how are coasts and coastal ecosystems\naffected. This can then provide the motivation for this study. At the moment I feel this\nparagraph is too general and vague to introduce the reader to the topic and the value of this\ninvestigation. As a result, the motivation is not clear.\n\nRV13. L79: Why is this relevant? Almar 2023 may have investigated the influence of ENSO as the\n\nauthors are, but other studies (apart from Almar 2023) exist that have performed regional\nanalyses at higher spatial scales (e.g., Vos et al., 2023; Castelle et al., 2024; Warrick et al.,\n2025). Please provide a few words to also recognise that other large-scale studies have been\nperformed at finer spatial scales and justify your choice of scale.\n\nRV14. Figure 1: Could you please indicate on the map where Long Beach, Monterey, Torrey Pines,\n\nand Playa el Suspiro are. Also, I feel this figure should appear later on in the results sections.\n\nRV15. L94-L98: Could you please provide some indicative figures (e.g., winter/summer Hs, Tp, etc)?\n\n### **2. Results **\n\nRV16. General: You provide acronyms for the four main regions but do not define them specifically. In\n\nthe text, you sometimes use the acronym and sometimes a description (e.g., southern\nCalifornia) but it is not always clear which are you are referring to. It would be beneficial to link\nthe two (perhaps in the Figure 1 legend?) to increase clarity.\n\nRV17. General: You mention that changes in storm tracks and storminess are a critical factor behind\n\nthe coastal responses, but you provide not quantification of these and how they vary across\nthe NAWC. Yet you do prove some very nice and detailed figures illustrating the impact of\nENSO on SLA (-8.0 cm – 8.0 cm) and discuss the waterline response to that. I am perplexed as\nto this disparity. If your findings indicate the coastal response to 16 cm SLA is more\npronounced than its response to increased storminess and changes in storm tracks, please\nprovide some supporting evidence.\n\nRV18. L101: Do you mean you average 125m either side of each transect?\n\nRV19. L103: Good choice! It is great thinking that we have data since 1984 but in reality, the data we\n\nhave prior to 2000 is so sparse it severely limits our analysis capability.\n\nRV20. L115: How was the 0.5m/year threshold calculated?\n\nRV21. L126: It is not clear to me at least how the comparison between seasonal and overall signal\n\nwas performed.\n\nRV22. Figure 2: This is a great plot that demonstrates the variability in the wave climate along the\n\nNAWC verry nicely. However, the latitude scales in (a) and (b-e) do not match so it is difficult to\nmake direct comparisons. Please align the two y-axis. Also, please clarify ‘Cycle range’ in (a)\nrefers to waterline excursion.\n\nRV23. L145-150: I can see in Figure 2a that there is a significant drop in wave power south of 34°N\n\naccompanied by an equally significant difference in wave direction (Figure 2c) and a noticeable\nshift in the timing and magnitude of negative SLA (Figure 2d). But the switch in the timing of\nthe erosion/accretion cycle seems to happen much further south, below 28°N and does not\nlook like it could be associated with the timing of the SL seasonal cycle that switches much\nfurther north, at least as shown in Figure 2. Are you referring to some previous work that has\nlinked the two? Also, it seems to me that below ~25°N the shoreline orientation is more\nsouthward (Fig2a) and the prevailing wave direction (Fig2c) so wave incidence is more oblique.\nThere also seems to be a definite shift in wave power seasonality with lower wave power\nduring the winter months and higher during the summer months. So very plausibly, the shift in\nthe waterline circle may reflect the aforementioned conditions rather than a 7-25cm SLA.\n\nRV24. L162-163 & Fig3: I will return to my earlier comment (RV12) that not enough information on\n\nthe behaviour and influence of ENSO on the wave climate has been provided and as a result.\nPlease include the relevant background info in the introduction.\n\nRV25. L163: The PDO is not introduced until L176. Please introduce in the first instance. Also, please\n\nintroduce it in the introduction and discuss interactions with ENSO.\n\nRV26. L178-180: I am not sure I understand why you characterise your ‘time coverage’ as limited. Are\n\nyou referring to the 1997-2021 period? If yes, I am guessing existing knowledge indicates the\n\nPDO has larger cycles? Again, this is not at all clear primarily because the background\ninformation is missing in the introduction.\n\nRV27. L174-182: Perhaps I am missing something, but I feel this is more of a discussion than the\n\npresentation of your results. Because of the lack of adequate information on the behaviour of\nENSO and its influence on the regional wave climates, and (complete absence of info on) the\nPDO, these statements are not supported here. I am also not sure I can see the notably less\npronounced influence of ENSO on PNW and NCA. For example, despite the admittedly much\ngreater variability in the waterline anomaly in PNW, both PNW and NCA plots show a drop in\n\nthe 2010 event followed by a steady increase up to 2016 and another large drop in 2016. This\nbehaviour is very closely mirrored by CP in panel (g), at least visually. Some quantitative results\nare necessary.\n\nRV28. L188 The PMM has also not been introduced or discussed thus far. Please provide the\n\nnecessary background information on the relevant climatic patterns in your introduction\n\nRV29. L183-190 Whether a correlation is positive or negative has no effect on its strength or\n\nstatistical significance. Here you characterise a correlation as ‘weak yet positive’. I imagine\n‘anti-correlations’ refer to negative correlations? Also, you are characterising similar values\ndifferently, sometimes referring to correlations in the order of 0.4 as weak (e.g., L196) and\nsometimes not. Lastly, please clarify if you are reporting R (Pearson or Spearman?) values and\nwhat level of statistical significance you are considering prior to reporting your findings.\n\nRV30. L196-2001: How do the two phases of ENSO relate to or are expressed in CP and EP? This\n\nshould also be mentioned in the introduction.\n\nRV31. L202-220: (please also refer to comment RV17). You mention that changes in storm tracks and\n\nstorminess are a critical factor behind the coastal responses, but you provide not\nquantification of these and how they vary across the NAWC. The discussion you have included\nmay be correct, but you provide the reader with no evidence, other than the waterline\nresponse shown in Fig4, of the forcing conditions during these events and how they change.\nYou use the EKE as a proxy for quantifying changes in storminess and show the contours on\nFig4, but you provide no quantification of how these relate to ‘…significant changes in coastal\nwave extremes.’ Please provide some information and a figure to demonstrate the spatial\ndistribution as they should be at least if not more important than the SLA shown in Fig4.\n\nRV32. L204: typo: remove full stop after the word ‘phase’.\n\nRV33. L202-228: A large part of this section discusses the influence of ENSO on the wave climate.\n\nThis should be part of your introduction, not your results. This is what will set the scene for\nyour waterline analysis.\n\nRV34. L216: you have already introduced EP and CP; there is no need to repeat here.\n\nRV35. L220-241: this is more of a discussion section.\n### **3. Discussion **\n\nRV36. General: I am missing a discussion on how your findings compare with the findings of previous\n\nworks. I am not an expert in your area, however, I am aware of at least on publication you also\ncite (Vos 2023). How do your results compare with theirs? Why do you think there are\n\ndifferences if these exists? Are your findings in line with current understanding of how this\nstretch of coastline has evolved? If not, what new have we learnt?\n\nRV37. General: I am also missing a discussion on the implications of your findings. Are there any\n\nobserved trends in ENSO? If yes, how do you think the NAWC might be affected in the future?\n\nRV38. L265-270: Here you partially address my comments RV17 and RV31. Yet throughout your\n\nmanuscript you refer to the influence of ENSO on storminess. I have a few comments relating\nto this:\n\nI. Several studies have demonstrated storm links between ENSO and wave\n\nconditions as you also indicate (e.g., L265-266). Do you have an explanation why\nin your case you did not find any?\n\nII. Could you please indicate the location of ERA5 node you used for the\ncomparison shown in Figure S3?\n\nIII. The absence of statistically significant correlations between wave power and\nENSO (in one location) does not imply the absence of a relationship between\nwave power and waterline response.\n\nRV39. I am not surprised you find weak and mostly not statistically significant relationships between\n\nENSO and coastal response as your finding also agrees with previous work. However, with this\nyou have, at least partially, disproved your hypothesis as stated in L155-158. You stress the key\nrole of wave forcing and storm impacts as a primary driver of coastal response throughout\nyour manuscript, yet you do not perform any relevant analysis. I strongly feel this is missing.\n\nRV40. L267: This is the first mention of MEI. Please include and explain earlier in the manuscript.\n\nRV41. L293-297: you mention the importance of the combined impact of elevated water level and\n\nstorm impact, yet miss the opportunity to demonstrate this at monthly, seasonal, or annual\ntimeframes. Though it is possible you find equally weak relationships due to the inherent\nnoisiness of SDS and (potentially) the quality of the wave data, I feel that without this analysis\n### **4. Conclusions **\n\nRV42. L318-321: I am perplexed at this statement as your findings indicate weak and mostly not\n\nstatistically significant relationships between climatic patterns and coastal response and you\nhave not shown any quantitative results relating wave energy to coastal response. Including a\nplot of wave power in Fig2b, in my view is not sufficient to support this conclusion.\n\nRV43. L324-325: Given the accuracy of the method as reported by Bergma 2024 (~10m), would these\n\nresults not indicate that most of the observed variability is within the uncertainty f the\nmethod, i.e., noise?\n\nRV44. L332-335: you have shown the 200hPa isobars in Fig4 and explain you are using EKE as a proxy\n\nfor changes in storm track but do not perform any analysis to support this statement. As a\nmatter of fact, the southern tip of the Baja peninsula shows the largest negative (erosion)\nanomaly in Fig4a, d, and e and this does not seem to relate to changes in storm track.\n### **5. Methods**\n\nRV45. L337: typo: ‘method **s’**\n\nRV46. L338: typo: replace ‘it consists in a…’ with: ‘it consists **of** a…’ however, the use of this\n\nexpression is not a good use of the English language in this case.\n\nRV47. L341: Who validate the application to the Landsat series? If I am not mistaken, Bergsma 2024\n\nmention that validation of the application of their method to the Landsat series imagery would\nconstitute further work ….\n\nRV48. L345: I believe Bergsma 2024 used the cirrus band and cloud mask in S2 to filter out cloud\ncontaminated images. If the SCoWI method is part of your work (or of others) please clarify\nand/or reference accordingly)\n\nRV49. L347: Highlighting the poor use of the expression: ‘thanks to…’ in this case.\n\nRV50. L347-348: One thing is defining the threshold using a refined Otsu approach, and another is\n\nderiving the waterline contour using a matching squares algorithm. This is not clear in the text\nat the moment.\n\nRV51. L349: GHSSH not defined\n\nRV52. L348-350: Please be consistent with the use of tense. E.g., ‘..waterlines are then…’ and\n\n‘…constituted…’. Please check consistency throughout the manuscript.\n\nRV53. L355: typos: ‘the time series…’ & ‘position **s** ’. Please check the use of singular instead of plural\n\nwhen referring to waterline positions throughout the manuscript.\n\nRV54. L345-359: Please rephrase this sentence. I know what you are saying is that at each time step,\n\nyou applied a tidal correction based on the estimated tidal elevation and the mean transect slope\nusing linear translation, but this section is poorly written and rather convoluted.\n\nRV55. L359: several studies have demonstrated that including run-up corrections is critical at low\n\ngradient sites. Figrue S7 suggests that a large proportion of the NAWC sites are dissipative, yet\nyou are not including runup corrections. Given this area is rich in data both measured and\nhigh-quality modelled data, could you provide some justification/explanation of your choice?\nHow do you think this might (or not) influence your results?\n\nRV56. L363-366: It is good to see that someone has considered the differences between satellite\n\nmissions!\n\nRV57. L388: Most studies use 100-150m-spaced transects (Mao et al., 2021; Castelle et al., 2022; Vos\n\net al., 2023), and this is still often not dense enough especially for small pocket beaches. Could\nyou please explain why you chose to use a wider transect spacing especially as the NAWC\ncoastline also includes many pocket beaches?\n\nRV58. L402: ‘… the average value of the signal…’ please clarify what you are referring to for the\n\nbenefit of the reader.\n\nRV59. L403: please clarify what Xw and Xtrend are for the benefit of the reader.\n\nRV60. L421-423: If storm track and storm wave intensity are parameters of interest as stated in L89\n90 but also throughout the manuscript, why not use some more direct measure of these? If\nnot, please provide some link between them and the EKE.\n### **6. Supplementary information **\n\nRV61. Figure S3: please indicate the location of the Columbia River Littoral Cell somewhere.\n\nRV62. Figure S5: please provide a legend for the colour scale used in b-e. What does the colour\n\nrepresent?\n### **REFERENCES ** Boak, E. H. & Turner, I. L. (2005) 'Shoreline definition and detection: A review'.
