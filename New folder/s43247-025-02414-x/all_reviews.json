    "Authors have perfectly employed waterline extraction and tide correction techniques. The methods adopted for trend and\nseasonal calculations, along with EP and CP indices sounds good. The claims of the authors, regarding ENSO and PDO\nevents with waterline position are well explained.\nFollowing points has been raised regarding the manuscript:\n\n01. Regarding Figure 02:\na) How the unit of wave power is translating to W/m (I suppose it is Watt per meter) from the formula mentioned, i.e., product\nof squared significant height and wave period?\nb) What is the reference of the formula of wave power that has been used?\nc) From the figure it is evident that wave power roughly ranges between -2000 to 2000 W/m. How can wave power be\nnegative?\nd) Regarding Fig. 2b, c, d and e, why the latitude in y-axis is not maintaining fixed distance, like Fig. 2a?\ne) Regarding the colour palette, higher wave power and sea level is represented in reddish and bluish for low values. This\nrepresentation is reversed for wave direction and waterline position. It would be better if consistency is mentioned, if there is\nno other reason behind choosing the palette.\n\n02. Authors have mentioned discarding 40% of transects from non-sandy beaches. Is there any specific reason for such\nremoval?\n\n03. In many instances, abbreviations mentioned for the first time in the manuscript are not in expanded form. For example,\nEP and CP are mentioned in line 162, but the expanded form is mentioned in the later part (line 185 and 187). Also, MEI\nmentioned in the line 267 has not been described in the manuscript (expanded form is mentioned in Supplementary Fig. 03).\n\n04. Regarding Figure S3, What is the unit of Wave Energy? The wave energy formula mentioned here is the same as the\nwave power formula mentioned in Figure 02.\n\n05. Authors have divided NAWC into five subregions. What was the basis of that classification?",
    "Lines 121–148: The lateral boundaries of the PNW, NCA, and other study areas are not clearly defined in climatological or\ngeomorphological terms. In Figure 1, the rationale for using a rectangular boundary is unclear. If waterlines are the primary\nfocus, offshore and nearshore limits might be more appropriately defined by features such as the dune front or depth of\nclosure. The geomorphic processes influencing responses to ENSO are not well articulated. Were any additional studies\nconducted to confirm that parameters such as beach slope, substrate lithology, or riverine sediment inputs do not\nsignificantly affect waterline positions on a seasonal scale? These factors appear to be omitted from the seasonal\ndiscussion in Figure 2.\nWhile this version addresses the points raised in my previous review, incorporating considerations beyond statistical\nprojections—such as relevant physical processes—could enhance the study's rigor and its appeal to an international\naudience",
    "I would like to commend the authors for their efforts and attention to detail in their responses to reviewers’ comments. The\nauthors have clearly spent a lot of time addressing and integrating extensive reviewer comments into their manuscript, and I\nhope they feel that their efforts have resulted in a significantly improved manuscript.\nTheir revised manuscript they have made substantial changes, including extensively restructuring the original manuscript,\nincorporating additional background information and reference to relevant literature, and providing additional quantitative\nresults. Their work addresses some long standing and highly relevant questions in the field of coastal dynamics the\nrelevance and importance of which is now clear and well supported. The authors also now highlighted some of the key\nnovelties of their study which, in my view, were previously understated. Overall, I find this is a manuscript of very high quality\nthat represents a significant contribution in the field. In my view, it is ready for publication, and I am looking forward to seeing\nit published in due course.\nKat Konstantinou."
