    "\nThank you for carefully revising the manuscript to address the Reviewers' concerns. The current version is much improved and more accessible to readers.\n\n[# PeerJ Staff Note - this decision was reviewed and approved by Brenda Oppert, a PeerJ Section Editor covering this Section #]\n",
    "\nThank you for your patience with the review process. I had an extremely difficult time finding suitable reviewers for your manuscript. I am glad that we have now two useful reviews. Please address the concerns of the reviews in your revisions.\n",
    "\nBasic reporting\nThe article is comprehensible overall, but it could be improved by addressing the comments about content and formatting below.\n\nLiterature references and background/context:\nLine 134 (Related Works section):  While having a comprehensive list of references can be useful, most of them are described in a single sentence. As a result, only a general description of each reference is provided, and their relationship to the current work is often unclear.\n\nThis section would be more valuable if the relationships between the references and the research reported in the paper were explicitly described, with sufficient detail to illustrate how the authors' approach improves upon weaknesses of previous approaches. \n\nFor example, many of the cited algorithms are aimed at classifying proteins according to structure or predicting protein structure. Their relationship to and utility for protein engineering applications are not clear. On the other hand, algorithms for identifying motifs appear to be relevant, but this was not obvious to me until I read the methods section.\n\nDiscussing the strengths and weaknesses of references that are more closely related to the reported research would enable readers to see how the authors' POET algorithm improves upon previous work.\n\n\nPresentation of Figures and Tables:\nBoth Fig. 5 and 6 plot RMSE versus Epoch number, but they use different types of RMSE’s (4 different RMSE’s are listed in Table 4). This is not clear from the plots or figure legends. The RMSE on the axes of each plot should be given different names.\n\nFigure 1: explain that the image on the right is a fitness landscape, with orange dots representing variants in the initial library and pink dots representing improved variants. It would be a good idea to add a cluster of orange dots to the fitness landscape in panel A to represent the library. This would more clearly show that the search space in experimental DE is limited.\n\nFig. 5: showing the epoch scale going up to 9 is confusing, since only 8 epochs were run\n\nRaw data availability:\nSource code and final data set are included as supplemental files, but their availability is not mentioned in the manuscript. The downloaded Learn_Dataset.csv appears to have 154 entries, but the methods section (line 327) says the final data set should have 163 entries.\n\n\nMinor clarifications in language:\nThe manuscript has a few typos (missing spaces (line 164 and a few other places), missing commas). \n\nLine 161 (…”to predict the DEAD box family”): Do you mean predict membership in the family of DEAD box proteins?\n\nLine 210: This is the first time the acronym RMSE is used, and it should be defined here.\n\nLine 396 – Discussion section: There is some redundancy between the results and discussion. Some statements in this section repeat conclusions that were discussed in the results section (rather than discussing them in the discussion section). For example, line 419 states that some of the identified proteins that had improved CEST values “do not necessarily follow conventional bio-engineering theories”, but the discussion does not explain what the conventional theories are. There is some explanation in the results section on this topic (line 388), but why positively charged amino acids would improve CEST contrast was not explained in terms of a biophysical theory. Also, line 141 states that the “findings demonstrate an improvement in the CEST levels of the predicted proteins”, but this is not shown clearly in either the results or discussion sections (see below).\nExperimental design\nThe authors describe the development and application of a genetic programming algorithm that performs in silico mutagenesis and screening to identify protein variants that score well against a model describing sequence motifs associated with a function (in this case, motifs in peptides that enhance MRI contrast). The advantage of this method for protein engineering is that virtual screening enables examination of both a larger number of variants and variants with wider sequence diversity compared to experimental directed evolution methods. The challenge of this method is to develop a model for screening the variants which correlates well with the desired functional properties of the evolved proteins. The authors choice to apply their method to discovering proteins with enhanced MRI contrast was an appropriate test of the method. A unique feature of the method is that it iterates through virtual model building, mutagenesis and screening and wet lab experiments. The winners In each round of directed evolution, or epoch, are added to the training set in order to improve the quality of the model. Screening candidates computationally drastically reduces the number of variants required for wet-lab screening. As long as POET accurately refines the model at each generation, the initial search space can be very broad, and still identify improved variants at the end of each epoch.\n\nThe algorithm was described well, but the methods and results sections need to be expanded to fully explain the experimental design and results.\n\nLine 241 (Methods section): the Methods section should also describe the wet-lab experiments, since the results of these experiments were used to refine the models in each epoch and to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Lines 378-384 in the results describe the metric used to measure CEST contrast levels, but the acronyms MTR and RF are not defined, and it is  unclear what tau refers to. While this needs clarification (and perhaps should be moved to the methods section), the rest of the experimental methods were left out. For example, how were the peptides synthesized/purified? What solution were their CEST values measured in?\n\nLine 295: di and fi need to be defined in the RMSE formula. Also, the section title says RMSE was used to evaluate the models built from the training data. Wasn’t RMSE also used to evaluate the fitness of each protein variant in the libraries?\n\nLine 317: At what point was the hydrophobicity threshold applied? After mutagenesis and before calculating CEST score? Perhaps this should be added to the flow chart in Fig. 2, or perhaps a more detailed flow chart of the POET screening and mutagenesis portion should be added.\nValidity of the findings\nAlthough the manuscript suggests that POET may be a valuable approach to protein engineering, some of the results are not shown or discussed clearly enough for readers to conclude that the method successfully identified proteins with higher MRI contrast.\n\nLines 385-387: This paragraph states that the CEST contrast value of the predicted peptides improved up to 400%. However, this cannot be evaluated, because the data is not shown. The data may be in the CEST contrast values in Table 2, but the table is not sorted by epoch. It would be useful to list the entries in Table 2 according to what epoch they were added to the data set. The CEST values (or the average value at each epoch) for the peptides in the initial data set and those added at each epoch should also be plotted to illustrate whether the CEST values increased, as expected.\n\nLine 336 (Evolution of Models per Epoch section, Figures 5, 6, Table 4): This section needs to be reorganized and slightly expanded to explain what the different RMSE measurements are and why they go up in some cases and down in others.  For example, Fig. 5 and 6, which examine two different types of RMSE, are described before Table 4, which lists what the different RMSE’s are. This made understanding why RMSE increased with epoch number in Fig. 5 but decreased in Fig. 6 very difficult to understand. It was difficult to understand why RMSE would increase at all, if the method is successful. The increase in RMSE was explained twice. The first explanation (lines 343-345) was unclear. The second explanation (lines352-354) makes more sense, but is still a little vague.\n\nLine 349 (“Test and training fitness values show a slight over-fitting of the models”): What data or analysis supports this conclusion?\n\nLine 350-1: The best models have 96-97 rules and express ~44 of them. For context, how many rules are used/expressed in average or poor models? Was there some expectation that maximizing the number of rules would improve the model? Why?\n",
