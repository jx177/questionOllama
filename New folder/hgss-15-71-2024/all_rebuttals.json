  "I am thankful to Ref.1 for his valuable criticism and his suggestions to improve my\nmanuscript. My point-by-point answers follow:\n\n*This is an interesting perspective on encyclopedias from the perspective of the*\n*description of lightning and thunder. It contains a range of worthwhile material, and*\n*it should be published in HGSS.*\n\n*I have two principal points to make about it. Firstly, the motivation for the work is not*\n*clearly enough provided at the outset. For example, the material at L38-41 could be*\n*given in the opening sentences of section 1. Secondly, the structure of the article needs*\n*to be outlined early on, probably in section 1.*\n\nI added the following sentences at the beginning of Chapter 1:\n\nThe motivation of this work was to study the development of descriptions and\nexplanations of lightning and thunder over the past two and a half millennia. A\nconvenient source for this purpose are encyclopedias, since they are supposed to\ncontain the actual knowledge of the respective age which has been accepted by the\nauthorities of the time, relaying often to earlier scholars. Their widespread circulation\nindicates that the readers appreciated exactly this purpose.\n\n*Currently, the sections are chronological, which is fifine. But a guide to what is coming*\n\n*- perhaps even a simple table - would help the reader further.*\n\nAt the end of Chapter 1 I added:\n\nStarting with the eminent Greek philosopher Aristotle in Chapter 2, we examine a few\nRoman enc. and several medieval enc. in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 5 deals with enc.\nof enlightenment and following times, and fifinally Chapter 6 with online- and a special\n\nenc.\n\n*L9 (and L12) \"wrong\" implies hindsight evaluation - better avoided. Just acknowledge*\n*that the medieval view was different to the modern view, and perhaps where it*\n*originated.*\n\nin L9 I changed „wrong“ into quite different from the modern view and in L12 „wrong\nand strange“ into from our present understanding unorthodox.\n\n*L16 Are all details of physical phenomena ever completely understood? It seems*\n*unfair to thunderstorm scientist to single them out.*\n\nI changed the sentence to Finally, it is stated that even today several details of\nthunderstorms are not well understood\n\n*End of Sect 1. Please add a few lines explaining the structure of the paper and how*\n*the subsequent sections are organised.*\n\nsee above\n\n*L60 Just point out that, at the time, they considered thunder to precede lightning. (The*\n*early authors would have had their own reasons, and it is only erroneous by modern*\n*investigations).*\n\nI changed the sentence to Here the most important assumption is that thunder precedes\nlightning, contrary to the modern view.\n\n*L95 Only some observations of ball lightning describe its ability to move through*\n*walls, so give a reference for this. A useful authoratative reference is Pippard 1982*\n*[https://www.nature.com/articles/298702b0](https://www.nature.com/articles/298702b0)*\n\nI included the reference and changed the sentence to … could be a ball lightning,\nsince some observations describe its ability to move through walls (e.g. Pippard\n1982):\n\n*L268 Electricity was described in the terms of the time: a modern judgement on its*\n*validity, requiring ions and electrons, is inappropriate here.*\n\nI changed the sentence to …to former explanations of lightning and thunder, although\nour modern view of electricity is different.\n\n*L277 Chree was superintendent of Kew Observatory (see MacDonald, 2018) and*\n*therefore a knowledgeable establishment fifigure. As was Abbe. Having such*\n*contributors may have caused a transformative step in quality.*\n\nI added here … British Professor and superintendent of the famous Kew Observatory\n**Charles Chree**\n\n*L300-309. This seems to be a footnote, or possibly, an endnote. Please be clear about*\n*how it links to the other material.*\n\nI cannot follow this suggestion because I think that mentioning the enc. of Fairy Tales\nis a remarkable supplement to this work. To make this clear I started this section with:\nIn order to supplement the so far treated enc with a completely different, non-natural\nscience perspective of our phenomena, a brief excursus to the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF\nFAIRY TALES is included. It is a German enc…\n\n*L310. This needs to be identifified as a separate section, for Online Encyclopedias.*\n*There is a point to be made about distributed authorship, in comparison with the*\n*authorships of the earlier material. Distributed authorship brings other issues -*\n*sometimes Wikipedia articles are poor and dominated by the erroneous views of one*\n*or a few non-expert individuals.*\n\nI started a new section here with: 6. Online Encyclopedias and a „Special\nEncyclopedia“\n\nIt should be emphasized that online enc. have a distributed authorship, quite different\nfrom the enc. treated so far where the authors are known. This means that\n\nWIKIPEDIA articles can contain questionable views of individuals.\n\n*Minor points*\n\n*L23 Encyclopedia*\n\n*L31 angel*\n\n*L152 Worth mentioning...*\n\n*L216 speed (not distance)*\n\n*L237 ...of environmental physics*\n\n*L347 Boys (The originator's name was Charles Vernon Boys).*\n\n**All corrected**\n\n",
  "I thank the referee for his valuable comments to improve my manuscript.\n\nHere is my reply:\n\n*Section 1: Introduction*\n\nThe other referee asked for a „personal motivation“ as well. I therefore\nincluded the following paragraph at the beginning of the introduction.\n\nThe motivation of this work was twofold. Fascinated by the ancient and modern\nencyclopedias as a summary of contemporary knowledge and continuing interest in all\nphenomena related to lightning and thunder, it suggests itself to study the development of\ndescriptions and explanations of lightning and thunder over the past two and a half\nmillennia in encyclopedias. They are supposed to contain the actual knowledge of the\nrespective age which has been accepted by the authorities of the time, relaying often to\nearlier scholars. Their widespread circulation indicates that the readers appreciated exactly\nthis purpose.\n\n*Section 5: Enlightenment and later*\n\nTo my knowledge an „end“ of enlightenment is not clearly defined. Therefore I\ncombined the encyclopedias dealt within in this section.\n\n*Current Section 6: Concluding remarks.*\n\nI rephrased this section as follows:\n\nIt should be emphasized that the explanations of lightning and thunder in enc. is\ncertainly not the only and the most appropriate way to document the progress in this\nfield. But it was an interesting endeavor regarding the author’s interest in enc.\nFor over two millennia the authors of enc. entries about thunderstorm effects did\nhardly dispute their ideas. They were regarded as true and correct, because former\n„authorities“ had stated them as well. This could be regarded as a kind of human\nhubris. Only from enlightenment onwards authors admit doubts and uncertainties in\ntheir texts. In the present WIKIPEDIA, is it stated at several places that there are still\nmany aspects of these phenomena are not yet fully understood. Among those are\nsome details of the cloud electrification and charge separation, the triggering of\nleaders, the role of infrasound in thunder, details of the terrestrial gamma-ray flashes\nand the physics of pearl lightning and ball lightning. Since the WIKIPEDIA entries\nare continuously refined, it is expected that these uncertainties will be addressed in\nthe future.\n\nThere is no doubt however, that important progress in the understanding of lightning,\nthunder and related phenomena is published beyond enc. In particular, studies\nemploying modern tools like Doppler radar, lightning detection by emitted radio\nwaves and multichannel spectral measurements from satellites can greatly enhance\nour knowledge of the complicated details of thunder and lightning. A remarkable\nexample of such a study was published by Schmidt et al (2012). Studies initiated and\nconducted within ICAE (International Commission on Atmospheric Electricity) a\nsub-group of IAMAS (International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric\nSciences) are expected to follow.\n\n"
