  "This study builds upon the Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI) v1.0 framework, advancing it to IMI 2.0 for monitoring total methane emissions with high resolution worldwide using TROPOMI satellite observations. The major advances involve the use of new observation data, improved consideration of inversion parameters (including state vectors and errors) and processes. These updates incorporate the outcome from a series of studies on methane inversion from the community. The capability of this new tool is demonstrated by a case demo of US methane emission. Overall, the manuscript is well-structured and well-written. It can be published once the following points are clarified.ÂLine 262: âwe modified GEOS-Chem to simulate multiple methane species as separate transported tracersâ It appears to me that the GEOS-Chem methane simulation only includes one tracer (methane), what does âmultiple methane speciesâ mean here? Are you referring to mean methane from different source?ÂLine 272: âPrecompiling emissions with HEMCO yields an additional 2Ã speed-up, for an overall 10Ã decrease in CPU cost and a net decrease in wall time. Uâ Could you explain what does âprecompilingâ refer to?ÂSection 3.4. I am a bit confused about the term âsuper-observationâ. It looks to me that the number of observations is reduced, but âsuperâ mispleads as âmore and strongerâ.ÂLine 304. It mentions âthreeâ updates but there are indeed four processes.ÂLine 335: I am curious about the extent to which boundary conditions would be adjusted in the inversion process if smoothed BCs were employed. Have the you tested this in the demo inversion?ÂLine399ï¼Could you provide a test demonstrating how OH optimization influences the regional inversion results? Why was OH optimization not utilized in the US demo?ÂTable 2: Could you provide a suggested values for the regularization parameter? Is it sensitive to the number of observations and state vector?Citation: https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2700-RC1",
  "Estrada et al. present an update to the Integrated Methane Inversion (IMI), a user-friendly tool to estimate methane emissions using TROPOMI XCH4 observations. The update to IMI 2.0 has extensive improvements over the original IMI, including the option to use a different TROPOMI product, different priors, point source satellite observations, improved BCs, lognormal PDFs, reduction of the state vector to improve computational efficiency and especially key, the use of Kalman filters to have near-real time continuous monitoring of emissions. The tool and its updates are valuable, and the paper is well written and structured. I recommend publication after the below comments are addressed. ÂThese comments generally relate to ensuring newcomers are aware of some nuances that come with using atmospheric inversions. I suggest this could be done in a separate âlimitationsâ section, or the individual points can be discussed where they are relevant throughout the paper. ÂNear-real time inversions are an impressive and important forward step. However, it feels as though the paperÂ needs a discussion of the issue of lack of validation data that comes with near-real time inversions. For example, anomalies and biases in TROPOMI products have sometimes been found after they have already been used in analyses. Validation of the satellite inversion results could also be carried out with independent surface-based observations, so that users can see an extra level of validation for the years with which these observations are available.Â Please could a discussion on validation be included. Could this also be a future aim of the IMI? Additionally, it would be interesting to know if you are intending on including both surface and satellite observations within the inversion framework in the future.ÂThe inclusion of another TROPOMI product (the GOSAT blended product) is valuable to compare inversion results from different products. However, I am surprised that there is no mention of the WFMD product from the University of Bremen. While it is not available in near-real time, it has a different retrieval algorithm from the operational product, making it useful to check for systematic biases. In some contexts (e.g. northern high latitudes) the operational product has been shown to have higher seasonal biases than the WFMD product (e.g. Lindqvist et al., 2024 - https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/16/2979).ÂIMI 2.0 currently relies on a single transport model and inversion framework, although some inversion parameters can be adjusted. I believe it would be helpful toÂ acknowledge that both the choice of transport model and inversion framework can impact posterior emissions estimates.Â This would be particularly useful for new users who may not be aware of this potential impact.ÂIf I am correct the inversion does not optimise separate sectors, and the emissions from each source sector are found using the prior fraction of emissions from each sector in each grid cell (line 483). Some inversion frameworks do optimise different sectors within the inversion (including a number in the latest Global Methane Budget - https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2024-115/) . Please could a discussion on this be included. ÂÂSpecific comments:ÂLine 43: Bottom-up methods also include process-based models (e.g. for wetlands).ÂLine 71: The link https://imi.seas.harvard.edu/ did not work for me at the time of opening it (404 site not found). ÂLine 79: Recently Vara-Vela et al., 2024 was published, which I believe also used the IMI. https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/23/4554ÂLine 114: Please could you comment on estimating offshore emissions whenÂ TROPOMI retrievals are removed from the ocean?ÂLine 161: This is a minor point and up to your discretion, but as someone more familiar with averaging kernel sensitivities in the satellite retrieval context, I initially found this section a bit confusing. Maybe it would be useful to make clear the distinction betweenain satellite retrievals andain this context?ÂLine 246: I think it would be useful here to briefly explain the reduced state vector alongside referring to Section 3.6. Without that context, itâs unclear why you need to enforce native resolution at the point sources.Â  Also, what is the specified threshold? Is it the 100kg h-1 referred to earlier?ÂLine 315: Please could you explain what kriged means? ÂSection 3.7: Relating to Section 3.10, is it also possible for the user to define a different OH field? This is another thing that can have a big impact on posterior emissions. ÂLine 397: Only the case for regional inversions using an Eulerian CTM? ÂLine 463: What is the impact on the natural soil sink of using a lognormal distribution that enforces positivity?ÂCitation: https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2700-RC2"
