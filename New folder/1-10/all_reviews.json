  "I am now satisfied with the changes that have been made by the authors, and these revisions have made an improvement from the first version of the article. \nThere are a few other minor concerns that the author may want to be consider; 1. All the data presented in this manuscript are generated by T cell lines or T cell \u201cclone\u201d. D10 cells are T lymphoblasts that continuously proliferate without stimulation, thereby exhibiting cancer cell properties. It is important to demonstrate this phenomenon occuring in vivo using primary T cells. \n2. It isn\u2019t very unclear how TCR internalization was measured by using anti-TCR antibody in the beginning and the end of incubation; this could be explained better. \n3. In the abstract, it would read better if the word \u201cinterestingly\u201d was deleted from the start of the second paragraph. ",
  "The findings concerning the role of TIM1 and domains thereof in the trafficking of T cells are original and important. \nThe manuscript is clear and uses powerful tools. I do have minor reservations on the discussion concerning apparent differences between findings in this paper and those reported elsewhere. The authors use a simple reductionist tool kit. Normal T cells are not studied (for reasons that are well justified). Differences in the cell population used in this and the cited works may or may not prove important. Next is the choice reagents to conduct the analysis. In mouse systems there are anti Tim1 antibodies that stimulate and others that inhibit T cell activation. It would be fascinating to learn (not in this paper) whether this is due to effects on Tim1 localization in or opposed to the IS. ",
  "The research described in this article is interesting, mostly well done, and worth publishing. \nMy major concerns:1. The manuscript over interprets some of the data.2. The polarized distribution of Tim1 needs a confirmation using primary T cells.3. The effects of Tim1 mutations on the distribution of signaling molecules should be included to support tyrosine phosphorylation data. "
