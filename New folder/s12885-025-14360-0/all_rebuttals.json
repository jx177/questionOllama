  "Dear Editor Thakar,\n\nWe appreciate the opportunity to address the revisions requested for our manuscript titled \"Association\n\nbetween serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and prostate cancer in middle-aged and elderly Americans: A\n\nnational population-based analysis of NHANES 2001–2018.\"\n\n1. Data Availability Statement:\n\nWe have updated the Data Availability statement both in the submission system and in the main\n\nmanuscript file (lines 342-345). The statement now clearly indicates that all research data used in this\n\nstudy are accessible from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) official\n\nwebsite. We have ensured that the statement in the system matches the one included in the manuscript.\n\n2. Clarification on Questionnaire/Interview/Survey:\n\nWe have reviewed and clarified the origin of the questionnaires, interviews, and surveys used in our\n\nstudy within the methods section of the manuscript (lines 75-78). These instruments are part of the\n\nNHANES database and are not newly developed for this study. They are standardized tools used by\n\nNHANES and are not previously published elsewhere as they are integral to the NHANES data\n\ncollection process. As such, we have not included them as supplementary files, given that they are\n\npublicly available through the NHANES website and are not specific to our research.\n\nWe trust that these amendments adequately address the concerns raised by the reviewers and are in line\n\nwith the journal's requirements.\n\nWe have resubmitted the manuscript with the updated Data Availability statement and the clarification\n\nregarding the questionnaires, interviews, and surveys.\n\nThank you once again for your guidance and for facilitating the publication process.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nXiangwei Wang\n\nDepartment of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, Guangdong\n\nProvince, China\n\nE-mail: winn0324@gdmu.edu.cn\n\n",

We believe that these\n\n104 revisions have significantly improved the quality of our manuscript and addressed the\n\n105 language-related concerns you raised.\n\n106\n\n107\n\n108\n\n109\n\n110\n\n111\n\n112\n\n113\n\n114\n\n115\n\n116\n\n117\n\n118\n\n119\n\n120\n\n4\n\n121 **Responds to the comments of reviewer 1**\n\n122\n\n123 **Response to comment#1:**\n\n124 As you pointed out in the introduction, half of the patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage.\n\n125 Therefore, underdiagnoses might be the biggest source of bias in this analysis. In the limitations,\n\n126 you only refer to memory bias. In this regard two things raised my attention. First, the higher\n\n127 frequency of prostate cancer in CVD cases might result from patients diagnosed with CVD are\n\n128 better checked regarding their health status and that’s why more cancer cases are reported in this\n\n129 group. Second, even though the differences between covariates are not statistically significant\n\n130 regarding the OR for prostate cancer, I think it is surprising that the categories no smoking, no\n\n131 alcohol and lower age showed higher ORs than the other categories, that are expected to be\n\n132 associated with higher cancer risk (figure 3). Therefore, please discuss the problem of\n\n133 underdiagnosis more extensively in the limitations.\n\n134 **Response:**\n\n135 Thank you for your insightful comments regarding the potential biases in our analysis, particularly\n\n136 the issue of underdiagnosis. We appreciate your attention to this important aspect and have\n\n137 carefully revised the limitations section of our manuscript to address these concerns more\n\n138 comprehensively.\n\n139 In response to your comments, we have added the following text to the limitations section:\n\n140 “Third, the asymptomatic nature of early-stage PCa may contribute to underdiagnosis, especially\n\n141 in populations with restricted access to routine health evaluations, resulting in incomplete case\n\n142 identification. The elevated PCa prevalence observed among individuals with CVD may, in part,\n\n143 reflect more intensive diagnostic surveillance within this group, as frequent clinical follow-ups\n\n144 increase the likelihood of cancer detection. Unexpectedly higher ORs in subgroups such as\n\n145 non-smokers, non-drinkers, and younger individuals may stem from disparities in screening\n\n146 frequency—those with healthier lifestyles tend to engage more consistently in preventive health\n\n147 practices, thereby raising the probability of early PCa detection. Consequently, the observed\n\n148 associations may partially reflect differential diagnostic exposure rather than underlying biological\n\n149 variation.” (Page 14, line 349-358)\n\n150 We believe that these additions provide a more thorough discussion of the potential biases related\n\n5\n\n151 to underdiagnosis and differential diagnostic exposure. We have also ensured that this new content\n\n152 is clearly integrated into the broader context of our study’s limitations, highlighting the importance\n\n153 of these factors in interpreting our results.\n\n154\n\n155 **Response to comment#2:**\n\n156 As different methods for the assessment of vitamin D were used, please consider a sensitivity\n\n157 analysis separating the two methods.\n\n158 **Response:**\n\n159 We sincerely appreciate this insightful comment. As suggested, we performed sensitivity analysis\n\n160 on the data of the two detection methods and observed that:\n\n161 1) In the 2007-2018 data (MS subgroup) determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography\n\n162 tandem mass spectrometry (uhplc-ms/MS), there was a stable positive correlation between serum\n\n163 25 (OH) D and the prevalence of PCa, which was consistent with our main research results (full\n\n164 cohort:2001-2018).\n\n165 2) No significant association was observed between serum 25 (OH) D and the prevalence of PCA\n\n166 using RIA subgroup data from 2001 to 2006. This result was in line with expectations. This\n\n167 difference was explained by the large measurement error of RIA method, the relatively small\n\n168 sample size or the different characteristics of early population exposure.\n\n169 3) Although the association between 25(OH)D and PCa was not statistically significant in the RIA\n\n170 group, the consistent direction (OR > 1) of point estimates across all groups (full cohort, RIA\n\n171 subgroup, MS subgroup) suggested the rationality of biology and the real effect that is not\n\n172 completely masked by measurement errors.\n\n173 4) Our research results (full cohort) may be driven by larger and more accurate data in the MS era.\n\n174\n\n175 In order to improve transparency, we have taken the following measures:\n\n176 1) In the part of research methods, the necessity of sensitivity analysis based on two detection\n\n177 methods was expounded:\n\n178 “Lastly, considering the use of two distinct analytical techniques for measuring serum 25(OH)D,\n\n179 logistic regression models were independently applied to each measurement method to validate\n\n180 the consistency of associations across assay types.” (Page 6, line 161-163)\n\n6\n\n181 2) Supplementary Table 3 (Table S3 ) was added to show the results of multivariate logistic\n\n182 regression analysis based on two detection methods. In the results section, we have made a\n\n183 detailed interpretation of the differences between the two kinds of sensitivity analysis:\n\n184 “Stratified multivariable logistic regression based on assay methodology further supported a\n\n185 consistent positive association between serum 25(OH)D levels and PCa prevalence in the\n\n186 2007–2018 subsample, where measurements were conducted using UHPLC-MS/MS. Compared\n\n187 with the <50 nmol/L reference group, the ≥100 nmol/L group exhibited higher effect estimates\n\n188 across models: model 1 (OR = 2.68; 95% CI, 1.78–4.04), model 2 (OR = 1.73; 95% CI,\n\n189 1.09–2.76), model 3 (OR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.01–2.60), and model 4 (OR = 1.63; 95% CI,\n\n190 1.00–2.65), all with significant trend tests (p for trend < 0.05) (Table S3). In contrast, no\n\n191 statistically significant relationship was identified in the 2001–2006 dataset based on RIA\n\n192 measurements (Table S3). This discrepancy may reflect greater variability associated with RIA,\n\n193 limited sample size, or distinct exposure profiles in earlier populations. Nevertheless, despite\n\n194 methodological differences, the direction of the effect estimates (OR > 1) aligns with results from\n\n195 the full cohort analysis.” (Page 11-12, line 261-271)\n\n196 3) In the discussion part, the differences of sensitivity analysis between the two methods were\n\n197 explained:\n\n198 ”Consistent with previous protocols, two distinct assay techniques were utilized to quantify serum\n\n199 25(OH)D levels[1]. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the LC-MS/MS method more effectively\n\n200 identified associations between 25(OH)D and PCa compared to the traditional RIA assay,\n\n201 emphasizing the influence of measurement precision in nutritional epidemiological studies.\n\n202 Although statistical significance was not reached within the RIA subgroup, all point estimates (full\n\n203 cohort, RIA subgroup, MS subgroup) aligned in direction (OR > 1), suggesting a consistent trend\n\n204 across methodologies that is not entirely confounded by measurement error.” (Page 13, line\n\n205 313-319)\n\n206 Reference:\n\n207 1.

As you work with cross-sectional data, please refer to prevalence or frequency as in the\n\n214 rest of the manuscript.\n\n215 **Response:**\n\n216 Thank you for your important observation regarding the terminology used in our manuscript. We\n\n217 fully agree that the use of the term “risk” in the context of our cross-sectional study was\n\n218 inappropriate and could lead to confusion.\n\n219 In response to your comment, we have carefully reviewed the abstract and the entire manuscript\n\n220 and have replaced the term “risk” with “prevalence” or “frequency” wherever it was used. This\n\n221 change has been made consistently throughout the manuscript to ensure clarity and accuracy in\n\n222 our reporting.\n\n223\n\n224 **Response to comment#4:**\n\n225 There might be residual confounding due to broad categories for physical activity and alcohol\n\n226 consumption.\n\n227 **Response:**\n\n228 Thank you for highlighting this critical limitation. We acknowledge that the binary classification\n\n229 of physical activity and alcohol use, based on NHANES questionnaire variables, may introduce\n\n230 residual confounding. We have expanded the discussion in the Limitations section as follows:\n\n231 “Fourth, the categorization of physical activity and alcohol intake—derived from predefined\n\n232 NHANES questionnaire items—lacks precision and may overlook variability in individual\n\n233 behavior patterns.”(Page 14-15, line 358-360)\n\n234\n\n235 **Response to comment#5:**\n\n236 Missing data should be reported more transparently (table 1).\n\n237 **Response:**\n\n238 Thank you for your valuable feedback. We have added Supplementary Table 1 to transparently\n\n239 report missing data distribution. In the statistical analysis section, we have also added an\n\n240 explanation: “Due to the limited number of participants diagnosed with PCa, multiple imputation\n\n8\n\n241 was implemented to address missing covariate data, with the extent of missingness detailed in\n\n242 Supplementary Table 1.”(Page 5, line 137-139)\n\n243\n\n244 **Response to comment#6:**\n\n245 Please consider adding some more information regarding the vitamin D levels (what are typical\n\n246 mean values, what values are recommended).\n\n247 **Response:**\n\n248 Thank you for your constructive suggestion. We have expanded the Discussion section to clarify\n\n249 clinical reference ranges and provide evidence-based recommendations. The specific\n\n250 modifications are as follows:\n\n251 “In the present analysis, the mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was 68.3 nmol/L, surpassing the\n\n252 ≥50 nmol/L threshold recommended by the National Academy of Medicine (US)[1]. These\n\n253 findings suggest that maintaining serum 25(OH)D levels within the range of 50–75 nmol/L may\n\n254 represent an optimal target. A notable increase in PCa prevalence was observed when serum\n\n255 25(OH)D concentrations exceeded 75 nmol/L (75–100 nmol/L group: OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.04–2.22,\n\n256 p = 0.031; ≥100 nmol/L group: OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.06–2.63, p = 0.029). In contrast, no elevated\n\n257 prevalence was detected within the 50–75 nmol/L range (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71–1.50, p = 0.853).\n\n258 Routine clinical monitoring of serum 25(OH)D is advisable to prevent sustained levels exceeding\n\n259 75 nmol/L. ” (Page 13, line 305-313)\n\n260 Reference:\n\n261 1.

Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 2011.\n\n264\n\n265 **Response to comment#7:**\n\n266 In the discussion section, you report on the results from the Scandinavian studies by Ahonen and\n\n267 Tuohimaa and state that the results are “biased” due to the low level of vitamin D. Please consider\n\n268 rephrasing, as in my view, this is not a methodological mistake. Vitamin D levels in different\n\n269 populations might not overlap much, that’s why different studies analyze different parts of the\n\n270 spectrum of vitamin D levels.\n\n9\n\n271 **Response:**\n\n272 Thank you for your detailed suggestions! We have rephrased the relevant discussion content based\n\n273 on the opinions to avoid negative evaluations of the original study and more accurately reflect the\n\n274 natural differences in vitamin D levels among different populations.\n\n275 Before:\n\n276 These low levels may be a key element leading to the the biased results. Recent research have\n\n277 shown that insufficient 25(OH)D concentrations may signal poor health conditions.\n\n278 Changed to:\n\n279 These lower values may reflect regional disparities in sun exposure and dietary vitamin D\n\n280 intake[1], which could partially account for divergent prevalence trends when compared to cohorts\n\n281 with higher baseline 25(OH)D status.

We agree that \"controversial\" could imply a debate\n\n308 beyond the scope of our study. As recommended, we have revised the opening sentence to more\n\n309 precisely reflect the current state of evidence, focusing on the lack of consensus rather than\n\n310 controversy.\n\n311 Before:\n\n312 It is still elusive and controversial how serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] influences the\n\n313 development of prostate cancer (PCa).\n\n314 Changed to:\n\n315 The impact of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] on prostate cancer (PCa) development\n\n316 remains inconclusive.

We have incorporated the specific number of prostate cancer cases\n\n324 into the main text.\n\n325 Before:\n\n326 Prostate cancer was identified in 3.3% of the whole study population.\n\n327 Changed to:\n\n328 PCa was diagnosed in 3.3% (n = 848) of participants.(Page 1-2, line 30-31)\n\n329\n\n330\n\n11\n\n331 **Response to comment#3:**\n\n332 Line 30 – 32: Only present result from the upper group with the p trend reported.

We have revised the sentence to focus on the upper vitamin D\n\n336 groups and retained the trend p-value.\n\n337 Before:\n\n338 In the fully adjusted model, higher concentration of 25(OH)D in the serum were associated with a\n\n339 higher prevalence of prostate cancer (50–75 nmol/L group: odds ratio [OR], 1.04 [95% CI,\n\n340 0.71–1.50]; 75–100 nmol/L group: OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.04–2.22]; ≥100 nmol/L group: OR, 1.67\n\n341 [95% CI, 1.06–2.63]; with <50 nmol/L group as the reference) (p for trend = 0.007).\n\n342 Changed to:\n\n343 After full adjustment for potential confounders, elevated serum 25(OH)D concentrations were\n\n344 positively associated with the prevalence of PCa (p for trend = 0.007).

Following the suggestion, we emphasized the minimum age for\n\n366 research.\n\n367 Before:\n\n368 Among Americans of middle to advanced age, a positive association was found between serum\n\n369 25(OH)D concentrations and the risk of developing PCa.\n\n370 Changed to:\n\n371 In adults over 40 in the U.S., higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations were positively correlated\n\n372 with PCa prevalence, with cardiovascular disease potentially modifying this relationship. (Page 2,\n\n373 line 40-41)\n\n374\n\n375 **Response to comment#6:**\n\n376 Keywords - Please add the following: biomarkers, NHANES\n\n377 **Response:**\n\n378 Thank you for your suggestion. This suggestion is great, and we have added these two keywords\n\n379 to the revised manuscript.(Page 2, line 43)\n\n380\n\n381 **Response to comment#7:**\n\n382 Line 60: Include a comment on the recency of these referenced studies to help contextualize the\n\n383 research landscape.\n\n384 **Response:**\n\n385 Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We agree that clarifying the temporal evolution of the\n\n386 evidence would strengthen the context of our discussion. As recommended, we have revised the\n\n387 paragraph to explicitly categorize the referenced studies by their publication periods and highlight\n\n388 the trend of recent research results.\n\n389 Before:\n\n390 Several cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies have demonstrated a positive correlation\n\n13\n\n391 between serum 25(OH)D levels and PCa risk[7,8]. On the contrary, some studies have reported a\n\n392 negative correlation[9,10]. In addition, three recent large prospective studies on United States\n\n393 (US), black, and European populations, respectively, neither reported a significant relationship\n\n394 between 25(OH)D levels in the serum and the risk of PCa nor supported the role of 25(OH)D in\n\n395 promoting or inhibiting the occurrence of PCa[11-13]. These inconsistent findings may be\n\n396 attributed to several variables, including population characteristics, ethnic and geographical\n\n397 differences, sample size, and research methods. Altogether, it is still uncertain if there is a\n\n398 correlation between 25(OH)D levels and the risk of PCa.\n\n399 Changed to:\n\n400 Initial investigations conducted before 2005 suggested a potential inverse relationship between\n\n401 serum 25(OH)D concentrations and PCa prevalence[1]. In contrast, studies published between\n\n402 2005 and 2015 largely failed to demonstrate any statistically significant correlation[2,3]. More\n\n403 recent analyses (2015–2025), particularly those focusing on subgroups such as individuals with\n\n404 cardiovascular disease (CVD), have identified a positive association[4-6]. This variability in\n\n405 outcomes may reflect the influence of diverse factors, including differences in population\n\n406 demographics, ethnicity, geographical region, sample size, study design, and advancements in\n\n407 assay precision for 25(OH)D quantification. Although the causal relationship remains unknown,\n\n408 contemporary evidence of higher methodological quality increasingly supports a positive link\n\n409 between elevated 25(OH)D levels and PCa development.

We provide the following explanation:\n\n558 1. We have excluded participants with missing 25(OH)D, meaning that our article didn't include\n\n559 participants with missing 25(OH)D.\n\n560 2. In our dataset, the lowest measured level of serum 25(OH)D was 8.32 ng/mL, which is above\n\n561 the LOD for both time periods. Therefore, we did not encounter any values below the LOD in our\n\n562 study population, and as a result, we did not need to apply any specific handling or imputation\n\n563 methods for such cases.\n\n564 3. According to the laboratory documents of NHANES in each cycle, we sorted out the LOD\n\n565 information of serum 25 (OH) D in different survey cycles and submitted it as supplementary\n\n566 materials.

As stated in the NHANES documentation, NHANES employs a\n\n629 stratified, multistage probability sampling design.

In this study, baseline characteristics across the four\n\n645 25(OH)D groups were compared using appropriate statistical tests based on variable types:\n\n646 1. Continuous variables (e.g., age, BMI, waist circumference, laboratory parameters): One-way\n\n647 ANOVA was applied for normally distributed data. For non-normally distributed variables (e.g.,\n\n648 triglycerides, creatinine), the Kruskal-Wallis test was used.\n\n649 2.Categorical variables (e.g., race, education, smoking status): Chi-square tests were employed to\n\n650 assess differences in proportions. For categorical variables with small expected cell counts (<5),\n\n651 Fisher’s exact test was utilized.\n\n652 These methods are standard for comparing group differences in observational studies and align\n\n653 with the presentation of means ( ± SD) for continuous variables and frequencies (%) for\n\n22\n\n654 categorical variables in Table 1.\n\n655\n\n656 **Response to comment#23:**\n\n657 23- Line 151: Suggestion to authors to remove word “initially” and proceed with the rest of the\n\n658 sentence.

We have revised the manuscript to address the clarity of\n\n770 Table 2’s statistical methods and effect estimates. The key modifications include:\n\n771 1. Clarification of Statistical Methods:\n\n772 The statistical method used in Table 2 is univariate logistic regression analysis. Added the\n\n773 following statement in the “ Statistical Analysis” section. To provide a clearer explanation, we\n\n26\n\n774 have added a description of the single factor analysis method in the statistical analysis section.\n\n775 Before:\n\n776 Multiple weighted multivariate logistic regression models were established to investigate the\n\n777 independent relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and the risk of PCa.\n\n778 Changed to:\n\n779 Weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were employed to examine the\n\n780 independent association between serum 25(OH)D levels and PCa prevalence. (Page 6, line\n\n781 145-147)\n\n782 2. Effect Estimates for Covariates:\n\n783 In the latest manuscript, all covariates in Table 2 clearly report OR and 95% CI.\n\n784 Before:\n\n785 Univariate analysis showed that age; race; marital status; waist circumference; diabetes;\n\n786 hypertension; family income; smoking status; and levels of triglycerides, albumin, total protein,\n\n787 and creatinine were related to the prevalence of PCa (Table 2)\n\n788 Changed to:\n\n789 Univariate logistic regression (Table 2) revealed positive associations between PCa prevalence\n\n790 and the following variables: age ≥60 years (OR 22.0, 95% CI: 13.25–36.57), waist circumference\n\n791 (OR 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00–1.02), diabetes (OR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.16–2.10), hypertension (OR 2.30,\n\n792 95% CI: 1.73–3.06), middle-income status (OR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.09–2.66), and former smoking\n\n793 (OR 1.46, 95% CI: 1.11–1.91). In contrast, being unmarried (OR 0.25, 95% CI: 0.15–0.41),\n\n794 current smoking (OR 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24–0.61), elevated triglyceride levels (OR 0.82, 95% CI:\n\n795 0.74–0.91), higher albumin (OR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89–0.96), and total protein concentrations (OR\n\n796 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93–0.99) were inversely associated with PCa prevalence (all p < 0.05).

Title of Figure 2\n\n799 As required, the title of Figure 2 was changed to: Table 2 Univariate logistic regression analysis of\n\n800 association between serum 25(OH)D and PCa prevalence (weighted)\n\n801\n\n802 **Response to comment#33:**\n\n803 33- Line 178: Please provide the p-trend estimates to support this sentence.\n\n27\n\n804 **Response:**\n\n805 Thank you for your detailed suggestions. We have supplemented the p for trend values of each\n\n806 model based on the specific data in Table 3.\n\n807 Before:\n\n808 Notably, the trend across all four models was statistically significant, with p-values being less than\n\n809 0.05.\n\n810 Changed to:\n\n811 The trend analysis across all models yielded statistically significant results (p for trend: <0.001,\n\n812 0.006, 0.012, and 0.007 for Models 1–4, respectively).

As requested, we have revised the caption of Figure 2\n\n833 to explicitly state the use of restricted cubic spline regression.\n\n28\n\n834 Before：\n\n835 Figure 2 Curve fitting for serum 25(OH)D levels with PCa.\n\n836 Changed to:\n\n837 Figure 2 Restricted cubic spline regression analysis of the dose-response relationship between\n\n838 serum 25(OH)D levels and PCa prevalence. (Page 9, line 219-220)\n\n839\n\n840 **Response to comment#37:**\n\n841 Please specify why the curve does not intersect with the y axis. Is this due to the LOD of the assay?\n\n842 If so, please indicate the value and specify this as a footnote.\n\n843 **Response:**\n\n844 Thank you for your comment regarding why the curve does not intersect with the y-axis in our\n\n845 restricted cubic spline regression analysis. This characteristic is primarily due to the following\n\n846 reasons:\n\n847 1. Detection Limit (LOD) of the Assay: The assay used to measure 25(OH)D levels in our study\n\n848 has a lower limit of detection (LOD). Specifically, the LOD for the 25(OH)D assay is 3.75 nmol/L\n\n849 for the period 2001-2006 and 2.03 nmol/L for the period 2007-2018. This means that any values\n\n850 below these LODs cannot be reliably detected or measured by the assay.\n\n851 2. Minimum Measured Value in Our Cohort: In our study cohort, the lowest measured value of\n\n852 25(OH)D was 8.32 nmol/L, which is above the LOD for both assay periods. As a result, the\n\n853 regression curve does not extend below this minimum measured value, and hence does not\n\n854 intersect the y-axis.\n\n855 To provide further clarity, we have added a footnote to the figure caption:\n\n856 \"Note: The lower limit of detection (LOD) of the 25(OH)D assay was 3.75 nmol/L for 2001-2006\n\n857 and 2.03 nmol/L for 2007-2018. \"(Page 9, line 221-222)\n\n858 We hope this explanation addresses your concern and provides a clear rationale for the observed\n\n859 pattern in our regression analysis.\n\n860\n\n861 **Response to comment#38:**\n\n862 Figure 3 High school should be capitalized in all categories\n\n863 **Response:**\n\n29\n\n864 We sincerely appreciate the your meticulous attention to detail. As suggested, we have revised all\n\n865 instances of \"high school\" to \"High School\" in Figure 3 to ensure consistent capitalization.

In the revised manuscript, a concise\n\n879 footnote was added to Figure 3 explicitly defining all health outcomes:\n\n880 \"Note: Hypertension: Confirmed diagnosis, antihypertensive medication use, or average blood\n\n881 pressure ≥140/90 mmHg; Diabetes: Clinical diagnosis, drug use, fasting blood glucose ≥7.0\n\n882 mmol/L, or glycosylated hemoglobin ≥6.5 mmol/L; CVD: Classified as congestive heart failure,\n\n883 coronary heart disease, angina/angina pectoris, heart attack, or stroke.\" (Page 10, line 236-239)\n\n884 All P-interaction values in Figure 3 and text have been reformatted to two decimal places (e.g.,\n\n885 0.659 →0.66).

We agree that describing\n\n891 the analysis as focusing on a subgroup is clearer and more accurate than implying that the data\n\n892 were re-obtained. We have revised the sentence as you suggested.\n\n893 Before:\n\n30\n\n894 The data of participants aged ≥60 years were re-obtained and examined (unweighted n = 9,734).\n\n895 Changed to:\n\n896 Among participants aged ≥60 years (unweighted n = 9,734), a consistent positive association was\n\n897 observed between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and PCa prevalence.

In our study, extreme serum\n\n903 25(OH)D levels were defined as values exceeding mean ± 3 standard deviations (SD). This is\n\n904 mentioned in paragraph 4 of the statistical analysis of the manuscript(line 158-159). This approach\n\n905 aligns with the statistical outlier removal method recommended by the Journal of Clinical\n\n906 Epidemiology for handling extreme biological values[1]. In our study, the mean and standard\n\n907 deviation of serum vitamin D were 68.3 ± 23.3. According to the exclusion criteria for extreme\n\n908 values, the upper limit range that needs to be excluded is>138.2 nmol/L. However, the serum 25\n\n909 (OH) D concentration cannot be negative, so the actual lower limit should be 0 nmol/L.\n\n910 Reference:\n\n911 1. Tukey, J. W. (1977). Exploratory Data Analysis.

If the authors are trying to suggest that the OR are\n\n915 similar in this sensitivity analysis and the full cohort analysis, this should be more explicitly\n\n916 stated.\n\n917 Response:\n\n918 Thank you for this helpful suggestion. We have revised the text to explicitly state the consistency\n\n919 between the sensitivity analysis and full cohort results, while including the specific OR values for\n\n920 clarity.\n\n921 Before:\n\n922 The results demonstrated that the positive association between serum 25(OH)D levels and PCa\n\n923 [risk remained unaltered in these participants (Table 4).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10011108/table/T4/)\n\n31\n\n924 Changed to :\n\n925 A persistent positive association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and PCa prevalence was\n\n926 observed in this cohort (Table 4), with an adjusted OR of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.14–2.09; p < 0.01) for\n\n927 the ≥100 nmol/L group.

As requested, all\n\n949 abbreviations in Table 4 (e.g., BMI, PIR, CVD) have been explicitly defined in a dedicated\n\n950 footnote section at the bottom of the table. For clarity, the footnote now reads:\n\n951 \"Abbreviation: OR, odds ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval; BMI, body mass index; PIR,\n\n952 poverty income ratio; CVD, cardiovascular disease.\" (Page 28, line 565-566)\n\n953\n\n32\n\n954 **Response to comment#47:**\n\n955 Suggested that the authors revise the first sentence of the discussion to highlight the main findings\n\n956 of the study (with an effect estimate interpretation) and the sample size.\n\n957 **Response:**\n\n958 Thank you sincerely for your constructive suggestion. The first sentence of the discussion has\n\n959 been revised to clearly emphasize the main findings and methodological advantages\n\n960 Before:\n\n961 This research was conducted to investigate the link between serum 25(OH)D levels and PCa\n\n962 prevalence in US males of middle to advanced age. The results confirmed that a rise in serum\n\n963 25(OH)D levels corresponded with an increase in the prevalence of PCa.\n\n964 Changed to:\n\n965 This large cross-sectional analysis involving 17,989 middle-aged and older adults in the U.S.\n\n966 identified a positive linear association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and PCa\n\n967 prevalence, with higher 25(OH)D levels correlating with increased odds of PCa (OR: 1.07; 95%\n\n968 CI: 1.02–1.12; p = 0.007).

To enhance clarity and eliminate redundancy in the\n\n989 discussion, we have removed the sentence: “The variability in findings might be partially\n\n990 attributed to extraneous factors that complicate the relationship with lower 25(OH)D levels in the\n\n991 blood.”\n\n992 Rationale for Deletion:\n\n993 1.Avoiding Redundancy: The deleted sentence broadly alluded to “extraneous factors,” which\n\n994 were later explicitly detailed in the subsequent text (e.g., demographic differences in sunlight\n\n995 exposure, dietary habits, and methodological variations). Retaining both statements risked\n\n996 repetition.\n\n997 2.Strengthening Flow: The revised paragraph now transitions directly from the inconsistency in\n\n998 findings to specific examples and evidence-based explanations, improving logical progression.\n\n999\n\n1000 **Response to comment#50:**\n\n1001 Line 249: Please include an effect estimate from the original paper.\n\n1002 **Response:**\n\n1003 Thank you for your suggestion to include an effect estimate from the original paper. We have\n\n1004 revised the sentence as you suggested to provide more specific details about the findings from the\n\n1005 Finnish study.\n\n1006 Before:\n\n1007 An early embedded case-control investigation carried out in Finland showed a linear relationship\n\n1008 between PCa and 25(OH)D levels, meaning that low 25(OH)D levels increased the probability of\n\n1009 PCa.\n\n1010 Changed to:\n\n1011 A study conducted in Finland reported an inversely linear association, where individuals in the\n\n1012 lowest quartile (median 27.8 nmol/L) exhibited a significantly higher PCa prevalence compared to\n\n1013 those in the highest quartile (median 70.3 nmol/L) (nonadjusted OR 3.1 and adjusted OR 3.5)\n\n34\n\n1014 (Page 12, line 280-283)\n\n1015\n\n1016 **Response to comment#51:**\n\n1017 Line 255: Remove extra “the”\n\n1018 **Response:**\n\n1019 Thank you for your careful review.

As suggested, we have removed the phrase\n\n1053 \"consistent with former findings\" from the original sentence to eliminate ambiguity.\n\n1054\n\n1055 **Response to comment#55:**\n\n1056 Line 288: Suggestion to rephrase from “notable” to plausible\n\n1057 **Response:**\n\n1058 Thank you for your careful review. The original text used the term “noteworthy” (“it is noteworthy\n\n1059 that...”), not “notable.” However, we fully agree with your suggestion and have revised the\n\n1060 sentence by replacing “noteworthy” with “plausible” to better reflect the scientific rationale.\n\n1061 Before:\n\n1062 It is noteworthy that vitamin D might be involved in the progression of prostate cancer cells.\n\n1063 Changed to:\n\n1064 It is plausible that vitamin D may play a role in the progression of PCa.

The strengths and limitations sections of this manuscript are also an honest evaluation of\n\n1081 the work. Addition considerations to further strengthen this paragraph include:\n\n1082 1. Discussion of seasonality of 25(OH)D biomarker and potential for bias introduced by this\n\n1083 **Response:**\n\n1084 We sincerely appreciate this insightful suggestion regarding the seasonal variation in 25(OH)D\n\n1085 levels. We have revised the limitations section to explicitly address this important consideration.\n\n1086 Before:\n\n1087 First, the 25(OH)D levels in the serum are affected by many conditions. Even though we\n\n1088 accounted for and controlled for several potential interfering elements in this study, other\n\n1089 confounding factors may exist. In addition, only a single measurement of serum 25(OH)D levels\n\n1090 might result in misclassification of an individual's chronic vitamin D status.\n\n1091 Changed to:\n\n1092 First, although multiple confounding variables are adjusted for, the possibility of residual\n\n1093 confounding cannot be excluded. Serum 25(OH)D is assessed through a single time-point\n\n1094 measurement, which may not accurately reflect long-term vitamin D status; moreover, seasonal\n\n1095 fluctuations in vitamin D levels are not incorporated into the analysis, potentially introducing\n\n1096 temporal bias. (Page 14, line 342-346)\n\n1097\n\n1098 2. Bias from imputation and handling of missing information\n\n1099 **Response:**\n\n1100 We sincerely appreciate this insightful comment. To address the potential bias related to missing\n\n1101 data handling, we have expanded the Limitations section to explicitly discuss this issue. Below is\n\n1102 the revised text:\n\n1103 “Fifth, although multiple imputation was applied to address missing covariate data (Table S1), this\n\n37\n\n1104 method relies on the assumption that data are missing at random. If the absence of data correlates\n\n1105 with unobserved factors, the imputation process could introduce systematic bias.” (Page 15, line\n\n1106 359-361)\n\n1107 3. Please revise the type of bias suggested through self-report of PCa. At present, memory bias is\n\n1108 cited; however, this reviewer does not find this compelling as cancer status is not often\n\n1109 misreported. If so, please provide an appropriate reference.\n\n1110 **Response:**\n\n1111 We appreciate this thoughtful comment regarding the nature of potential bias in self-reported PCa\n\n1112 data.

I have no further comments and I am\n\n35 very pleased with the way you reacted to my suggestions.\n\n36 Response:\n\n37 Thank you very much for your positive feedback and for acknowledging the thorough revision of\n\n38 our manuscript. We are pleased to hear that you are satisfied with the changes we have made and\n\n39 the way we have addressed your suggestions.\n\n40 We appreciate your time and effort in reviewing our work, and we hope that our manuscript now\n\n41 meets the standards required for publication.\n\n42\n\n43\n\n44 **Responds to the comments of reviewer 2**\n\n45\n\n46 **Response to comment#1:**\n\n47 Introduction - Clear and integrated changes contextualize the previous literature on the topic.\n\n48 Response:\n\n49 Thank you for your positive comments on the introduction section. We are pleased that the\n\n50 changes made have been recognized as clear and well-integrated, effectively situating our study\n\n51 within the broader context of existing literature. We have taken your feedback seriously and have\n\n52 ensured that the introduction provides a solid foundation for understanding the significance and\n\n53 context of our research.\n\n54\n\n55 **Response to comment#2:**\n\n56 Methods - Line 108: Please specify that PCa diagnosis was self-reported.\n\n57 Response:\n\n58 Thank you very much for your insightful comments. We have revised the manuscript accordingly.\n\n59 Specifically, we have added the phrase \"self-reported\" to clarify that the diagnosis of prostate\n\n60 cancer was based on participants' self-reports.\n\n2\n\n61 Before:\n\n62 Responses to the items “Have you ever been told that you have cancer?” (MCQ220) and “What\n\n63 kind of cancer was it?” (MCQ230) were utilized to identify participants diagnosed with PCa.\n\n64 Changed to:\n\n65 Responses to the items “Have you ever been told that you have cancer?” (MCQ220) and “What\n\n66 kind of cancer was it?” (MCQ230) were utilized to identify participants with a self-reported\n\n67 diagnosis of PCa.

We have carefully considered your suggestion\n\n73 regarding the clarification of the age group categories and have revised the relevant section\n\n74 accordingly.\n\n75 Before:\n\n76 Age was stratified into two categories: ≥40 years and ≥60 years.\n\n77 Changed to:\n\n78 Age was stratified into two categories: 40 -60 years and ≥60 years. (Page 5, line 117)\n\n79\n\n80 **Response to comment#4:**\n\n81 Line 125: Were CVD conditions self-reported? If so, please state.\n\n82 Response:\n\n83 Thank you for your insightful comments regarding the clarification of how CVD conditions were\n\n84 determined in our study. We have revised the relevant sentence to explicitly state that the CVD\n\n85 conditions were self-reported by the participants.\n\n86 Before:\n\n87 CVD included conditions such as congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina,\n\n88 myocardial infarction, and stroke, consistent with definitions used in prior cohort studies.\n\n89 Changed to:\n\n90 CVD was defined based on self-reported conditions such as congestive heart failure, coronary\n\n3\n\n91 heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, and stroke, consistent with definitions used in prior\n\n92 cohort studies. (Page 5, line 126)\n\n93\n\n94 **Response to comment#5:**\n\n95 The changes integrated into this section significantly improve the robustness of the methodology\n\n96 and clarity of the section.\n\n97 Response:\n\n98 Thank you very much for your positive feedback on the methodology section of our manuscript.\n\n99 We are pleased that the changes we made have been recognized as significantly improving the\n\n100 robustness and clarity of this section.\n\n101 We have carefully reviewed the methodology section again to ensure that it provides a clear and\n\n102 detailed description of our research design, data collection, and analysis procedures. We believe\n\n103 that the current version of the methodology section effectively supports the credibility and\n\n104 reproducibility of our study.\n\n105\n\n106 **Response to comment#6:**\n\n107 Results- Line 183: Separate into two sentences and please contextualize the model 1 finding\n\n108 before presenting the results for model 2,3, and 4. This can be done using the same language\n\n109 found on Line 186.\n\n110 Response:\n\n111 Thank you for your valuable feedback and suggestions. We have carefully revised the sentence to\n\n112 better contextualize the findings from Model 1 before presenting the results of the subsequent\n\n113 models. The revised sentence now clearly highlights the positive association observed in the\n\n114 unadjusted Model 1 and how this association persists after adjusting for various confounders in\n\n115 Models 2, 3, and 4.\n\n116 Before:\n\n117 A consistent positive association between serum 25(OH)D levels and PCa prevalence emerged\n\n118 across all four statistical models (Table 3). The unadjusted OR in Model 1 was 1.11 (95% CI,\n\n119 1.06–1.16; p < 0.001), while the adjusted ORs in Models 2, 3, and the fully adjusted Model 4 were\n\n120 1.07 (95% CI, 1.02–1.12; p = 0.003), 1.07 (95% CI, 1.02–1.12; p = 0.009), and 1.07 (95% CI,\n\n4\n\n121 1.02–1.12; p = 0.007), respectively.\n\n122 Changed to:\n\n123 A positive association between serum 25(OH)D levels and PCa prevalence was observed in the\n\n124 unadjusted Model 1 (OR, 1.11; 95% CI: 1.06–1.16; *p* < 0.001). This association persisted in\n\n125 Models 2, 3, and 4 after sequential adjustments for demographic, clinical, and laboratory\n\n126 confounders, with adjusted ORs of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02–1.12; p = 0.003), 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02–1.12;\n\n127 p = 0.009), and 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02–1.12; p = 0.007), respectively (Table 3). (Page 7, line\n\n128 184-188)\n\n129\n\n130 **Response to comment#7:**\n\n131 Line 190: Please clarify that the p-trend analysis across clinical cutpoints is significant, suggesting\n\n132 evidence for a dose-response relationship.\n\n133 Response:\n\n134 Thank you for your insightful comment regarding the dose-response relationship. We have revised\n\n135 the text to explicitly highlight the significance of the p-trend analysis and its implications for a\n\n136 dose-response relationship, as suggested. The key modifications include:\n\n137 1. Specifying clinical cutpoints: we now clearly list the 25(OH)D categories (<50, 50-75, 75-100,\n\n138 ≥100 nmol/L) in the p-trend analysis description.\n\n139 2. Emphasizing dose-response evidence: added the phrase \"indicating a dose-response\n\n140 relationship\" to directly link the significant p-trend with this conclusion.\n\n141 3. Strengthening context: the restricted cubic spline results are now presented as corroborating\n\n142 evidence for this relationship.\n\n143\n\n144 Before:\n\n145 The trend analysis across all models yielded statistically significant results (p for trend: <0.001,\n\n146 0.006, 0.012, and 0.007 for Models 1–4, respectively). A dose–response curve constructed using\n\n147 RCS further confirmed a robust linear relationship between serum 25(OH)D and PCa prevalence\n\n148 (nonlinear P = 0.621) (Figure 2), indicating a progressive increase in PCa probability with rising\n\n149 25(OH)D levels.\n\n150 Changed to:\n\n5\n\n151 Importantly, the p-trend analysis across clinical cutpoints (<50, 50–75, 75–100, ≥100 nmol/L) was\n\n152 statistically significant (p for trend = 0.007), indicating a dose-response relationship between\n\n153 ascending serum 25(OH)D categories and increased PCa prevalence. This linear association was\n\n154 further corroborated by restricted cubic spline analysis (Figure 2), which showed a progressive\n\n155 rise in PCa probability with higher 25(OH)D levels (nonlinear P = 0.621). (Page 7, line 193-197)\n\n156\n\n157 **Response to comment#8:**\n\n158 Table 3: Please provide the n in the table title\n\n159 Response:\n\n160 Thank you for your suggestion to include the sample size n in the title of Table 3. We have revised\n\n161 the table title to reflect the unweighted sample size used in the analysis.\n\n162 Before:\n\n163 Table 3 Logistic regression analysis of the association between serum 25(OH)D and prostate\n\n164 cancer(weighted)\n\n165 Changed to:\n\n166 Table 3 Logistic regression analysis of the association between serum 25(OH)D and prostate\n\n167 cancer(weighted; unweighted n=17,9894) (Page 24, line 518)\n\n168\n\n169 **Response to comment#9:**\n\n170 Please move Table 3, Figure 2 & 3 down with the other tables and figures. It is challenging to read\n\n171 when not all tables and figures are together.\n\n172 Response:\n\n173 Thank you for your suggestion regarding the placement of Table 3, Figure 2, and Figure 3. We\n\n174 have moved these elements to be placed together with the other tables and figures in the\n\n175 manuscript. This change should improve the readability and flow of the document, making it\n\n176 easier for readers to reference all visual elements together. (Page 24, 27, 28)\n\n177\n\n178 **Response to comment#10 and #11:**\n\n179 Line 250: Specify that this sensitivity analysis was conducted in all age groups, as the previous\n\n180 analysis was in only respondents older than 60.\n\n6\n\n181 Line 254: Combine this paragraph with the previous one as they are discussing the same\n\n182 sensitivity analysis subgroup.\n\n183 Response:\n\n184 Thank you for for these related suggestions. We have addressed both comments through the\n\n185 following revisions:\n\n186 1. Combined paragraphs for clarity: The sensitivity analyses (excluding extreme values and\n\n187 incomplete covariate data) are now presented in a single paragraph to improve readability, while\n\n188 retaining all original statistical results.\n\n189 2. Clarified age group coverage: We explicitly stated that analyses excluding extreme 25(OH)D\n\n190 values and incomplete data were conducted in the full cohort (all age groups), whereas the\n\n191 subgroup analysis for participants aged ≥60 years is presented separately.\n\n192 These revisions ensure the scope of each analysis (subgroup vs. full cohort) is clearly\n\n193 distinguished without altering the scientific content.\n\n194\n\n195 Before:\n\n196 Among participants aged ≥60 years (unweighted n = 9,734), a consistent positive association\n\n197 was observed between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and PCa prevalence. This relationship\n\n198 persisted whether age was modeled as a continuous variable (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03–1.09; *p* <\n\n199 0.001) or categorized by serum 25(OH)D levels (75–100 nmol/L: OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05–1.62;\n\n200 ≥100 nmol/L: OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.13–1.97) (p for trend < 0.001) (Table 4).\n\n201 After excluding individuals with extreme 25(OH)D values (unweighted n = 17,820), the\n\n202 strength and direction of the association remained consistent. The adjusted ORs for the 75–100\n\n203 nmol/L and ≥100 nmol/L categories were 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10–1.67; *p* < 0.01) and 1.62 (95% CI,\n\n204 1.22–2.15; *p* < 0.01), respectively (Table 4).\n\n205 After excluding participants with incomplete covariate data, multivariable analysis was\n\n206 performed on the remaining 14,904 individuals. A persistent positive association between serum\n\n207 25(OH)D concentrations and PCa prevalence was observed in this cohort (Table 4), with an\n\n208 adjusted OR of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.14–2.09; *p* < 0.01) for the ≥100 nmol/L group.\n\n209 Changed to:\n\n210 A consistent positive association between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and PCa prevalence was\n\n7\n\n211 observed across sensitivity analyses. Among participants aged ≥60 years (unweighted n = 9,734),\n\n212 this relationship persisted whether age was modeled as a continuous variable(OR, 1.06; 95% CI,\n\n213 1.03–1.09; *p* < 0.001) or categorized by serum 25(OH)D levels (75–100 nmol/L: OR, 1.30; 95%\n\n214 CI, 1.05–1.62; ≥100 nmol/L: OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.13–1.97) (p for trend < 0.001) (Table 4). In the\n\n215 full cohort (all age groups), after excluding individuals with extreme 25(OH)D values\n\n216 (unweighted n = 17,820), the strength and direction of the association remained consistent. The\n\n217 adjusted ORs for the 75–100 nmol/L and ≥100 nmol/L categories were 1.35 (95% CI, 1.10–1.67; *p*\n\n218 < 0.01) and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.22–2.15; *p* < 0.01), respectively (Table 4). Similarly, in the\n\n219 complete-case analysis of the full cohort (unweighted n = 14,904), a persistent positive association\n\n220 was observed between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and PCa prevalence for the ≥100 nmol/L\n\n221 group (OR, 1.54; 95% CI: 1.14–2.09; *p* < 0.01) (Table 4). (Page 8, line 205-216)\n\n222\n\n223 **Response to comment#12:**\n\n224 - Line 258: Please add commas after regression and methodology and provide the assay groups in\n\n225 ().\n\n226 Response:\n\n227 Thank you for your careful review. We have addressed your comment regarding adding commas\n\n228 after \"regression\" and \"methodology\" and providing assay groups in parentheses. For clarity, we\n\n229 implemented these revisions in the sentence beginning \"Stratified multivariable logistic\n\n230 regression...\" (Line 217 in our manuscript), which discusses the assay methodology. We appreciate\n\n231 your attention to these important methodological details.\n\n232 Before:\n\n233 Stratified multivariable logistic regression based on assay methodology further supported a\n\n234 consistent positive association between serum 25(OH)D levels and PCa prevalence in the\n\n235 2007–2018 subsample, where measurements were conducted using UHPLC-MS/MS.\n\n236 Changed to:\n\n237 Stratified multivariable logistic regression, based on assay methodology (RIA: 2001–2006;\n\n238 UHPLC-MS/MS: 2007–2018), further supported a consistent positive association between serum\n\n239 25(OH)D levels and PCa prevalence in the UHPLC-MS/MS subsample.
