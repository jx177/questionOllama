  "We are grateful to the reviewers for their time and effort in reviewing our manuscript. Since\nseveral similar comments were raised by all the reviewers, below is a short response to the main\ncomments of all reviewers:\n\n  Spin-lock profile of ¹H in 99.96% D₂O were acquired and added to the main text.\n\n  The discussion regarding the simulations was extended. In particular, numerical\nsimulations were compared with the first-order Hamiltonian solution.\n\n  We added more simulations and discussion to emphasize that the appearance of rotaryresonance conditions in isotropic samples is not due to the amplitude or width of the\ndistribution (either external magnetic field or radio-frequency field irradiation). While the\namplitude and width of the distribution influence the width of the rotary-resonance\nconditions, the modulation frequency, and the minimum intensity of the spin-lock signal\nat these conditions, the rotary-resonance conditions arise due to the periodic dependence.\n\nBelow is a point-by-point response (in blue) to reviewer comments (in black).\n\n**Anonymous Referee #1**\n\n1) Numerical simulations\n\nThe description of the numerical simulations provided in the SI suggests that the authors performed\nsimulations for a single-spin-1/2 system by numerical integration of the Liouville-von Neumann\nequation. Based on Eq. (S2), both the initial density operator as well as the detection operator\ncorrespond to Ix (x magnetization). For simulations taking the spatial rf-field inhomogeneity into\naccount, the Hamiltonian of the system corresponds to a spinlock along the x-axis (Eq. (S3C)) and an\northogonal component along the y-axis that is modulated by the MAS frequency (Eq. (S3B)). This will\ngenerate an effective field whose orientation and magnitude will be modulated by the MAS frequency\nand about which the magnetization will nutate. Due to spatial inhomogeneity of the rf field, the\norientation and magnitude of this effective field will vary across the sample space. The authors model\nthe spatial rf-field distribution using distribution functions f_B1 (that models the amplitude distribution\nalong the rotor axis) and f_nu1 (that models the magnitude of the modulated component along the yaxis) and compute the total signal as the weighted average of these distributions (Eq. (S2)).\nUnfortunately, the functional forms of these distribution functions are not provided (which they should\nbe) and can only be approximated based on Fig. S1. Since no other spin-spin or spin-field interactions\nare mentioned, it must be assumed that no other interactions are taken into account, which would be in\nline with an isotropic sample of an isolated nucleus. Moreover, the authors explicitly say that no\n\nrelaxation is taken into account in the simulations and the effect therefore has to be coherent in nature.\n\nHowever, computing the signal based on this information (which is computationally inexpensive for a\nsingle-spin system) does not lead to the same results presented by the authors in Fig. 3 in the main text.\nI would therefore ask the authors to provide additional information on how the simulations were\nperformed.\n\nWe have added the Table S1 to the supplementary information (SI), which summarizes\nthe used weighting factors:\n\n|Col1|The Amplitude (in kHz)|The weighting factor|\n|---|---|---|\n|𝐵 modulation<br>0<br>k=[1:51]|0.2(𝑘−1)/𝑉|2(𝑘−1)/𝑉2|\n\n\n\n1\n\n|𝐵 modulation, time-<br>1<br>independent<br>l=[1:29]|0.05<br>𝜈 (1 −(𝑙−1) )<br>𝑆𝐿 𝑀|(𝑙−1) 2 𝑀 (𝑙−1) 2<br>−(1.89 ) −(1.89 )<br>𝑒 𝑀 / (∑𝑒 𝑀 )<br>𝑙=1|\n|---|---|---|\n|𝐵 modulation, time-<br>1<br>dependent<br>k=[1:29]|(𝑘−1) 4<br>−(1.26 )<br>0.1𝜈 (1 −𝑒 𝑊 )<br>𝑆𝐿|(𝑘−1) 4 𝑊 (𝑘−1) 4<br>−(1.26 ) −(1.26 )<br>𝑒 𝑊 / (∑𝑒 𝑊 )<br>𝑘=1|\n\n\n**Table S1** The summary of the amplitudes and the weighting factors for *B* 0 and *B* 1 modulations (the simulations are\nshown in Figures 4 and 5 in the main text). In simulations, M=29, W=29 and V=51.\n\nWe have also extended our discussion regarding the simulations and added the first-order\nHamiltonian solution, comparing it with the numerical simulations. The following paragraph has\nbeen included in SI:\n\n“ *To understand the origin of the pseudo RRD effect, we start with the simplest case,*\n*investigating the behavior of a single on-resonance spin during the rf-field spin-lock (* 𝐻 𝑆𝐿 ) *. The*\n*single spin inside the coil may be affected by an additional time-periodic term (* 𝐻 𝑡 ) *, orthogonal*\n*to the applied rf-field spin-lock. For simplicity, we also do not include any relaxation effects.*\n\n*This additional term can depend on the external magnetic field (B* *0* *modulation), or the strength*\n*of the applied RF-field spin-lock (B* *1* *modulation). In solid samples, it can arise due to*\n*anisotropic interactions. The first and second modulations are related to inhomogeneities in the*\n*external magnetic field and RF field, respectively. The third could arise in liquid-like samples if*\n*there is some degree of alignment and therefore residual anisotropic interactions present.*\n*Knowing the exact values of these modulations (and shapes in the case of the distribution) is*\n*important when their influence is investigated quantitatively for a specific coil. Our goal here is*\n*the qualitative determination of the source of the pseudo RRD effect in the experiments.*\n\n*In all three cases, the total Hamiltonian for this spin can be described as follows:*\n\n𝐻 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝐻 𝑆𝐿 + 𝐻 𝑡 = 𝜔 𝑆𝐿 𝐼 𝑥 + 2𝜋∑𝑎 𝑛 𝑛 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑛𝜔 𝑅 𝑡+ 𝜙 𝑛 )𝐼 𝑧 𝑂𝑝̂ *,* *Eqn.

Additionally, the profiles show that the*\n*rotary-resonance conditions are narrow: a deviation of only 100 Hz from these conditions*\n*almost completely removes the influence of the time-dependent term on the spin-lock signal in all*\n*figures.*\n\n5\n\n***Figure S3*** *Numerical SL profiles showing the influence of time dependence introduced via B* *0* *modulation (* 𝑎 1 =\n0.5𝑎 2 = 100 *Hz, A, D and G), dipolar interaction (* 𝜈 𝐷 = 200 *Hz, B, E and H) and B* *1* *modulation (* 𝑎 1 = 0.25𝑎 2 =\n0.01𝜈 𝑆𝐿 *, C, F and I). The simulated signal is shown as a function of the rf-field strength (* 𝜈 𝑆𝐿 *, axis y) and mixing*\n*time (* 𝑡 𝑆𝐿 *, axis x) of the SL under three different MAS rates: 10 kHz (A-C), 20 kHz (D-F) and 35 kHz (G-I). The*\n*values in gray represent the coordinates of the first minimum in the profiles. No phenomenological relaxation was*\n*included in the simulations.*\n\n*In addition to time dependence induced by B* *1* *inhomogeneity, there is also time*\n*independent inhomogeneity,* [5–10] *which is most clearly seen along the axis of the rotor.

Experimentally,*\n*the reason of the appearance of this term is due to the fact that a solenoidal coil produces a*\n*higher rf-field at the center, as compared with the edges.

While the value of* Δ 𝐵 1\n*as well as the weighting factor can be different from coil to coil, this term is not the source of the*\n*appearance rotary-resonance conditions. However, this term broadens the rotary-resonance*\n*conditions and alters the positions and values of the first minimum signal intensities, as shown in*\n*Figure S4.*\n\n*As in the previous simulations, for B* *0* *modulation (A, D and G) and dipolar interaction (B, E and*\n*H), changes in MAS do not affect the modulation frequency, while for B* *1* *modulation (C, F and*\n*I), this is not the case. Additionally, for both B* *0* *modulation and dipolar interaction, the*\n*intensities at the first minima show a dependence on MAS rate, while for B* *1* *modulation, they do*\n*not (marked in gray in Figure S4). This differing dependence on MAS rate for B* *1* *modulation*\n*versus B* *0* *modulation and dipolar interaction could indicate which effect plays a major role in*\n*rotary-resonance condition experiments for isotropic samples. Since the rotary-resonance effect*\n*is observed for* *[1]* *H* *spins in 99.96% D* *2* *O (Figure 3A-B in the revised main text), the dipolar*\n*interaction was not included in simulations in the main text.*\n\n7\n\n***Figure S4*** *Numerical SL profiles with an additional time-independent term (* Δ 𝐵 1 = 0.05 *, Eqns.

The values in gray represent the coordinates of*\n*the first minimum in the profiles. No phenomenological relaxation was included in the simulations.* ”\n\n2) Model for the rf inhomogeneity\n\nIn my opinion, the model used for the spatial distribution of the rf-field in a solenoid coil is not\nappropriate due to the following issues: - The authors assume an amplitude deviation from the nominal\nspinlock amplitude of only 0-5% (Eq. (S3C)). However, both simulated (e.g. Tosner et. al. 2017) and\nmeasured (e.g. Gupta et. al. 2015) rf-field distributions of common MAS NMR probes suggest that the\nfield drops to approximately 50% at the edges of the sample space. Since there is no mention of spatial\nsample restriction to the central part of the rotor, the chosen amplitude distribution is not appropriate. \n8\n\nFor a maximum deviation of the spinlock amplitude of 5% the signal weighting function given in Fig. S1C\nis not appropriate. According to the reciprocity theorem (e.g. Hoult 1976), the induced signal is directly\nrelated to the B1 field of the receiving coil at a given position in the sample space. A deviation from the\nnominal field by 5% should therefore not lead to a weighing of the signal with a factor of close to zero as\nis shown in Fig. S1C. - The orthogonal component (Eq. (S3B)) occurs due to the MAS modulation of the\nphase of the rf irradiation which is known to be strongest at the edges of the sample space (e.g. Tosner\n2017). Since the spinlock amplitude is also significantly lower than the nominal spinlock amplitude in\nthese parts of the sample, the rotary resonance condition is no longer fulfilled in these parts of the\nsample and the coil sensitivity is significantly lower. However, the model implemented by the authors\nuses the same magnitude of the modulation for all values of f_B1. Since simulated realistic rf-field\ndistributions can be found in the literature (Tosner et. al. 2017), I would suggest that the authors\nperform their simulations using such a distribution instead of this crude model that\n\nThe following figure depicts the Fourier Transform of the nutation curve (black), which\nwas acquired using a series of 1D ¹H experiments in 99.96% D₂O as a function of the single\npulse length, ranging from 0.5 μs to 160 μs in 0.5 μs steps. The Gaussian function (red dashed\nline) with a standard deviation of 0.027μ (μ = 79.5 kHz) shows that this distribution can\napproximately be considered Gaussian (as reported in previous works), [4–6] and that the 5%\nmaximum deviation used in the simulations approximates the actual distribution. The exact\ndistribution would only be necessary for quantitative comparison with experiments.\n\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) of 1D [1] H signal as a function of the length of single proton pulse (black) and\ncomparison with a Gaussian function (red dashed). The sample was 99.96% D 2 O. For FFT, MATLAB software was\nused. The experiments were performed at 10 kHz MAS.\n\n3) Isotropic sample\n\nThe experimental results presented in the paper stem from measurements of a polybutadiene rubber\nsample as well as a polyethylene glycol sample. Although these sample exhibit “liquidlike” spectra, they\n\n9\n\nboth correspond to large polymer systems, where partial alignment might lead to residual anisotropic\ndipolar interactions that will be recoupled for irradiation at a rotary resonance condition. The\ncomparison of experimental spectra of the rubber sample with and without MAS (Fig. S4A) shows that\nthe static spectrum is significantly broader than the one under MAS. This line broadening can either be\nattributed to residual anisotropic interactions or susceptibility effects and raises the question if either of\nthe two are re-introduced by irradiating at the rotary resonance condition which would lead to signal\ndecay. The authors attribute the observed signal decay solely to the modulation of the rf-field due to the\nrf inhomogeneity, based on numerical simulations of a single-spin system. This raises the question why\nthe authors didn’t choose to demonstrate the effect using a truly isotropic system (such as, for example,\nthe residual H2O line in D2O) that would correspond more closely to what is simulated.\n\nThe suggested experiments were performed and included into the revised version of the\narticle as Figure 3. We also observed rotary-resonance conditions for [1] H in 99.96% D 2 O.\n\n1 H in 99.96% D 2 O experiments. (A) 1D spectrum recorded at 10 kHz MAS. (B) 1 H signal is shown as a functions of\nthe rf-field strength (𝜈 𝑆𝐿, y-axis) and mixing time (𝑡 𝑆𝐿, x-axis) of the SL pulse. The sample contained Cu [2+]\nethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (5 mM) to accelerate the acquisition.\n\n4) Additional Remarks:\n\n- The different positions of the minima of the signal intensity in the experimental and simulation results\n\nis never discussed.\n\nThe positions of the signal intensity minima in the experimental and simulated SL\nprofiles are similar. In the experimental profiles, we observe minima at approximately 2.4 ms,\n2.4 ms, 1 ms, and 0.4 ms for 10 kHz, 10 kHz half-windowed, 25 kHz, and 35 kHz MAS,\nrespectively. In the simulations, these values are 1.8 ms, 1.8 ms, 0.9 ms, and 0.5 ms. In the\nexperiments, the minima positions are broader than in the simulations. For example, for 10 kHz\nMAS (Figure 2A), the minima can be identified between 1.8 ms and 3 ms, where similar minima\nintensities are observed. The intensity values at these minima points depend on the amplitude of\nthe *B* 1 -modulated term. Since our goal is a qualitative comparison of the experimental and\nsimulated SL profiles, we do not expect a full agreement between them.\n\n- I think the authors should put more emphasis on distinguishing coherent from incoherent effects that\nlead to signal decay. Since the experimental data clearly shows an oscillating behavior and no stochastic\n\n10\n\nprocesses (e.g. molecular motion) are taken into account in the numerical simulations that are used to\nexplain the observed phenomenon, the underlying mechanism has to be coherent. However, the\nabstract of the paper suggests “maxima in relaxation rates” (p. 1, l. 15) and “enhanced transverse\nrelaxation” (p.1, l.10), which makes it sound like the observed signal decay is due to incoherent line\nbroadening.\n\nWe corrected the mentioned sentence:\n\n“ *A drastic reduction in spin-lock signal intensities is observed when the spin-lock frequency*\n*matches one or two times the MAS rate. Under these conditions, the spin-lock signal decays at a*\n*much higher rate, and oscillations of the signal are observed, consistent with a coherent origin*\n*of the effect.* ”\n\nA comparison with the first-order Hamiltonian solution (please refer to the response to point #1)\nemphasizes that we are considering only coherent effects.\n\n- In the experimental data, it is not clear what the “signal intensity” is that is plotted. Is this the\nintegrated intensity or the maximum peak intensity?\n\nThe peak maximum was used to plot all SL profiles, except for one in Figure S4 of the\nsupplementary information (first version), where both the integrated intensities and peak\nintensities were measured from the same experimental data. We have added clarification to the\nfigure captions.\n\n- In the text and the figure legends the spinlock amplitude is referred to as nu_SL whereas in the axis of\n\nthe figure it is denoted by nu_RF. The nomenclature should be consistent to avoid confusion.\n\nCorrected.\n\n- The discussion of other reports of the effects of the MAS modulation of the rf field due to the spatial\n\ninhomogeneity is rather minimalistic. The authors may want to include the seminal works by Tekely and\n\nGoldman for example. o Goldman, M. and Tekely, P.: Effect of radial RF field on MAS spec tra, CR Acad.\n\nSci. II C, 4, 795–800, 2001. o Tekely, P. and Goldman, M.: Radial-field sidebands in MAS, J. Magn. Reson.,\n\n148, 135–141, 2001.\n\nWe have added the citation of the mentioned works with the following discussion. In\naddition we cite Aebischer et al. MR 2021, in which radial spatial inhomogeneity is investigated.\n\n“S *ome other works regarding the effects of radial RF field on MAS spectra have been reported*\n*previously,* [3,9,12,13] *where the appearance of sidebands due to time-dependent rf-field*\n*inhomogeneity was theoretically explored and experimentally demonstrated. Particularly,*\n*Aebischer et al.* [3] *investigated the influence of time-dependent modulations of the rf-field*\n*amplitude and phase on the performance of selected solid-state NMR experiments. The influence*\n*of both amplitude and phase modulations was observed in samples with non-vanishing*\n*anisotropic interactions. These modulations did not significantly affect most recoupling*\n*sequences, with the exception of double quantum C-symmetry sequences.* [14] *Consistent with the*\n*matching conditions identified in this study, Aebisher et al.* [3] *revealed significant amplitudes at* 𝜈 𝑅\n*and* 2𝜈 𝑅 *in nutation spectra.*\n\n**Referee #2: Zdeněk Tošner**\n\n11\n\nThis contribution reports about a surprising observation that T1rho of liquid-like samples\nshows enhanced relaxation at rotary resonance conditions known from rotating solids. It is\nnot expected for samples where dipolar interactions are completely averaged by fast\nmotions. It is argued that this phenomenon arises when liquid-like samples are rotated in a\nspatially inhomogeneous radiofrequency field of solenoid coils. Consequently, similar effect\ncould be expected for solids, changing thus interpretation of rotary resonance relaxation\ndispersion experiments.\n\nWhile I understand urgency of this report, I would appreciate a more thorough study. Here\n\nare my concerns:\n\nRubber and polymer samples are liquid-like, but not quite typical liquids. There still might\nbe nonzero residual dipolar couplings. MAS imposes centrifugal forces and polymer\nparticles may become “solidified” on the rotor walls – can it be excluded?\n\nWe also observed rotary-resonance conditions for [1] H in 99.96% D 2 O. See also the\nresponse to point #3 from Reviewer 1.\n\nIf the explanation is solely time-variable rf field, it can be modelled in liquid state probes\nwithout sample spinning by applying shaped pulses. These experiments would then be\nvery convincing experimental proof of the phenomenon.\n\nWe have simulated the effect as fluctuations in the z-component of the rf field generated\nby a solenoid tilted at the magic angle. (The y-component can also be significant.) The situation\nis quite different in a solution probe, where generation of a z-component would not be achievable\nwith the coil. Yes, a y-component could be generated with a digitized shape pulse. However, this\nartificial setup would not add much to what is already evident from the simulations, in our view.\nIt would not tell us whether B 0 or B 1 fields are more significant in the MAS rotor.\n\nQuality of the supporting material is not sufficient to reproduce the simulations. There are\nmany typos and unclear nomenclature. For example, what is integral of “df dg f(x) g(B1)”\n(what is the “df” element?) The time-variable rf Hamiltonians are defined using a sum\nover n (n=1, 2) of cos(\\omega_R t) – there is no “n” under the sum. A graph of these\nHamiltonians would help. No reasoning is given for f(\\nu_1) being biquadrate exponential\ndistribution function, etc…\n\nFor simulation details, please refer to the response to point #1 from Reviewer 1. We\nthank the reviewer for pointing out the missing ‘n’ in Eqn. (S3). We added the sentence\nregarding the biquadrate exponential distribution function:\n\n“ *The bi-quadrate exponential distribution function does not represent the real distribution of the*\n*time-dependent B* *1* *modulation; it simply provides non-linear sampling, different from the time-*\n*independent term.* ”\n\nI miss more detailed simulation study on the extent of rf modulations introducing\nenhanced relaxation. I mean some assessment what the amplitude of rf modulations\nmust be, perhaps in relation to the nominal rf amplitude, to observe the phenomenon? RF\n\n12\n\nfield modulations within an MAS rotor are of different amplitude, depending on the\nposition along the coil axis as well as on the radial distance… In simulations, 10%\namplitude modulations are assumed regardless of the position.\n\nWe agree that more a detailed simulation study is important, when this effect is\nquantitatively investigated for a specific coil. However, it is beyond the scope of this article, as\nour goal is to illustrate the effect. Our approach does not explicitly consider radial distance.\nHowever the inclusion of a distribution of amplitudes for the modulation does approximate the\nsituation in the sample.\n\n- Our detailed calculation of rf field in solenoids show MAS induced variations on the\nfrequency of \\omega_R. Where exactly is the origin of the second recoupling condition at\ntwo times \\omega_R? It comes naturally from MAS modulations of the residual dipolar\ncouplings (rank-2 tensors) but rf field is modulated at just a single frequency…\n\nThe amplitude and phase profiles in the previously reported work [9] are not purely\nsinusoidal. This makes sense when considering a location in the rotor that passes close to a coil\nturn over a small angular distance, and is otherwise far from that coil turn, and is particularly\nnoticeable towards the edge of the coil. Since the wave is not purely sinusoidal, there are\ncontributions from overtone frequencies (see e.g. sawtooth or triangular waves, in which many\novertones are present). We kept only n=1 and n=2, since these are clear experimentally.\nHowever, rotary-resonance conditions with n>2 may also be observed. n=3 appears to show up\nvery weakly in the new D 2 O data, in which we sampled more carefully around this condition.\n\n**Anonymous Referee #3**\n\nWould one expect such behavior for water or generally for molecules tumbling in the\npicosecond time scale, true \"liquid-like,\" for example, glycine in water? Is there any\nspecific reason for restricting the study to PEG and rubber? The molecular weight of the\nPEG used in the study is unclear. One would also expect high molecular weight PEGs to\nshow anisotropic molecular tumbling or sediment on the rotor wall. Perhaps data on\nmolecules showing averaging of dipolar interactions would be comprehensive proof.\n\nWe also observed pseudo rotary-resonance conditions for [1] H in 99.96% D 2 O. See also the\nresponse to point #3 from Reviewer 1.\n\nPerhaps it might be helpful to measure the rotation correlation timescale of the PEG\nsample instead of making a hand-waving argument.\n\nSince we see the effect in the residual water in D 2 O, this should not be necessary (the\neffect is not dependent on the change of rotational correlation times between PEG and water).\n\nThe decay of magnetization appears (not sure) to indicate minima/oscillations. Is this a\nfeature of incoherent effects?\n\nThis is a characteristic of the coherence effects. We corrected the sentences that\n\npreviously mistakenly implied incoherent effects were being considered.\n\n13\n\nIs there any special reason for using different decoupling schemes at different MAS\nfrequencies, especially if the claim is that the samples are \"solution-like\"? It's probably not\na relevant point, but it's just curiosity.\n\nThe same decoupling scheme was used at different MAS frequencies. However, different\ndecoupling schemes were used for different probes: WALTZ16 [15] for the 1.3 mm and SW f TPPM [16] for the 4 mm. There was no particular reason for this; it is just the result of setting up\nthe sequences for the different probes, and selecting a decoupling sequence.\n\nComparing Figure 2 and Figure 4, despite using smaller rf inhomogeneity in simulations\ncompared to typically reported on MAS probes, the magnetization decays substantially\nfaster in simulations. What is the experimental rf inhomogeneity of the rf field?\n\nPlease refer to the response to point #4 from Reviewer 1. The key feature of the\ninhomogeneity has to do with the oscillatory part, which is not easy to characterize\nexperimentally.\n\nThe simulation details are sketchy, especially the terms in Eq S2.\n\nPlease refer to the response to point #1 from Reviewer 1.\n\nBy naively looking at Equations S3A and S3B, it's not so apparent why the simulations\ndiffer except for the weighting factors, which have a different slope and magnitude. In Eq\nS3, \"n is missing\" in the cosine term. Is there a justification for summing over n=1,2, or is\nit motivated by experimental observations?\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing ‘n’ in Eqn. (S3). The summing over\nn=1, 2 was motivated by experimental observation, despite the possibility for higher values of n\nto contribute.\n\nIs it sufficient to consider inhomogeneity distribution along one axis in both scenarios?\nWhy should that be the case?\n\nWe have chosen not to explicitly simulate over the spatial axes of the sample, but rather\nprovide a qualitative simulation. Quantitative agreement would require a more detailed\nsimulation, and also taking precautions that there is little to no air bubble present after sample\nloading, otherwise the very center of the rotor will not be filled with sample. (In case the reviewer\nrefers to spin axes, in revised version we show simulations, in which we consider *B* 0 and *B* 1\nmodulations along the same spin axis ( *I* z ).)\n\nMinor points\n\nPage 3, line 9 chose\n\nWe are not sure what the reviewer means. With the addition of the water sample, this text now\nreads:\n\n14\n\n“ *The same behavior is observed for a polyethylene glycol solution at 10 kHz MAS and for*\n*residual protons in liquid deuterium oxide.*\n\n*We chose these samples since the polybutadiene rubber displays liquid-like spectra but does not*\n*undergo translational diffusion due to the elastomeric properties of a cross-linked polymer. On*\n*the other hand, since the polybutadiene is an elastomer and therefore may not undergo perfect*\n*isotropic averaging, we also recorded data for a polyethylene glycol solution and liquid water* .”\n\nDifferent figures have different labels for the rf axis.\n\nCorrected.\n\n(1) Mehring, M. *Principles of High Resolution NMR in Solids*, 2nd ed.; Springer-Verlag: Berlin\n\nHeidelberg, 1983. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-68756-3.\n(2) Olejniczak, E.
