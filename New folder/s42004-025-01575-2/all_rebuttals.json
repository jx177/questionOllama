  "\n\n## **REVIEWER REPORT(S): **\n### **Referee #1 and #2 **\n\nBonomo and co-workers describe the development of cholinium halide/glycerol deep\n\neutectic solvents (DES) as effective I2 sorbents, being the first time that they were directly\n\nused for I2 gas-phase capture. The captured I2 can be partially released under relatively\n\nmild conditions, showcasing the DES's potential for semi-reversible I2 storage. The Raman\n\nspectroscopy study offers detail on the species involved in the capture process, which\n\nserves as a basis for further investigations. In addition, the obtained results show\n\nreproducibility and consistency when analyzing data from different techniques.\n\nConsidering the low cost and broad availability of the DES components, these systems\n\ncould be of interest not only to the academic community but also for their potential\n\napplication in the field.\n\nAlthough the experimental results thoroughly support the specific statements presented,\n\nwe recommend a few additional straightforward experiments to bolster the data.\n\nWe are thankful to the referee #1 and #2 for the general positive evaluation of our\n\nmanuscript and for the very meaningful suggestions. We specifically commented on all the\n\nissues raised and we modified the manuscript accordingly. After the modifications, we are\n\nfairly confident that the manuscript could be accepted for publication in Communications\n\nChemistry.\n\n|Major|Col2|\n|---|---|\n|The stability of the system once the<br>I2 is captured in the DES is a<br>relevant parameter that has been<br>measured by others in related<br>studies (Green Chem., 2016,18,<br>2522-2527 and ACS Appl. Mater.<br>Interfaces 2025, 17, 8382−8393). It<br>would be interesting to analyze the<br>behavior of these mixtures<br>regarding their stability over time.|We agree on this point. Indeed, the stability of the<br>I -loaded DES is quite important, especially<br>2<br>envisaging an industrial application. We are<br>currently working on this, also using Raman to<br>determine the speciation of I-containing species.<br>In the submitted version of the manuscript, we did<br>not explicitly discuss this point because the main<br>focus was the presentation of DES as effective<br>iodine sponges.<br>However, in the meantime, we have continuously<br>monitored the I -loaded DESs, and they are pretty<br>2<br>stable over time under ambient conditions (i.e. an<br>open vial at RT and atmospheric pressure). As a<br>matter of fact, after an initial slight decrease in<br>weight (i.e. 3-6%, likely due to the evaporation of<br>the physically sorbed Iodine at the DES surface), it<br>maintains a relevant constancy over 42 days of<br>exposure.<br>The following short paragraph has been added in<br>the main text to better discuss this point:<br>“Once reached the plateau of the I uptake, all the<br>2<br>samples showed a quasi-solid gel-like behaviour,<br>which is even more evident when the samples are|\n\n|Col1|cooled down to RT. This is fairly ascribable to the<br>establishment of a new iodine-based interaction<br>between DES moieties (see Raman section). The<br>high-energy nature of the latter leads to extremely<br>stable I -loaded sponges which lose only an<br>2<br>amount between 3% and 6% of mass after more<br>than one month (i.e. 42 days) of storage under<br>ambient conditions. As shown in Supplementary<br>Figure 1, almost all the weight is lost within the first<br>4 hours of storage, likely due to the evaporation of<br>the loosely interacting I at the DES exposed<br>2<br>surface. If on the one hand, the establishment of<br>highly energetic interactions is surely an added<br>value in terms of long-term stability toward safe<br>and reliable industrial application, it would also<br>require some energy to allow an effective de-<br>loading of the iodine (vide infra).”|\n|---|---|\n|Considering the gravimetric<br>methodology and the inherent<br>hydrophilicity of the DESs, it is<br>important to address potential DES<br>hydration in the I2 uptake<br>experiment.

Based on<br>previous findings [21], the theoretical maximum<br>water absorption capacity for these kinds of<br>systems is approximately 10% by mass, which<br>would represent only 2–3% of the total uptake<br>observed (i.e. a value within the experimental<br>uncertainty).

Glycerol (Gly)-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have\n\nrecently emerged as promising and novel solvents for iodine uptake from the vapor phase.\n\nThe iodine uptake performance varies depending on the choice of cholinium salt (Ch+) as\n\nthe hydrogen bond acceptor (either iodide or chloride) and its relative ratio with glycerol (1:2\n\nor 1:3). Among these, the ChCl:Gly (1:2) system exhibits the best performance, reaching up\nto 4 g·g⁻¹ after 24 hours. Furthermore, the captured iodine can be effectively released\n\n(approximately 80%), demonstrating the potential of DESs as iodine sponges. Raman\n\nspectroscopy has been employed to confirm the speciation of iodine-based species within\n\nthe DES, which opens up avenues for further engineering of these systems. These results\n\nhighlight Gly-based DESs as a sustainable, low-cost solvent for efficient and semi\nreversible iodine capture.\n\nBefore publication, the following points should be addressed:\n\nWe thank the referee #3 for the very positive feedback on our manuscript. We carefully\n\nconsidered all the comments raised and modified the manuscript accordingly.

Furthermore,<br>a reliable quantitative Raman analysis would require<br>knowledge of the Raman cross-sections for each species<br>(same for absorption coefficients in UV-Vis spectroscopy),<br>which falls beyond the scope of this communication. This<br>aspect will certainly be addressed in future and more<br>focused studies, particularly once we will gain access to<br>the low frequency region of the Raman spectrum.|\n|The iodine capture rate<br>appears to depend on the<br>viscosity of the DESs.<br>Please provide the viscosity<br>data for the DESs and<br>discuss this point. A<br>relevant reference for this<br>discussion is Physical<br>Chemistry Chemical<br>Physics, 24 (42), 26029-<br>26036.|We kindly disagree with the reviewer on this point.<br>Although a dependence of I uptake on viscosity could not<br>2<br>be excluded a-priori, it seems far to be straightforward.<br>Indeed, based on our previous publication (see Bonomo,<br>M. et al. Journal of Molecular Liquids, 2020, 319, 114292),<br>pure glycerol and the 1:3 ChCl:Gly mixture showed the<br>highest and the lowest viscosity, respectively, with the 1:2<br>ChCl:Gly mixture showing intermediate values (closer to<br>1:3 ChCl:Gly, indeed). However, this trend seems not to be<br>replicated in the Iodine uptake values, with 1:2 ChCl:Gly<br>showing the highest amount. As such, even if it could be<br>speculated that the much higher viscosity of pure glycerol<br>has a negative effect in I diffusion (and uptake) throughout<br>2<br>the solvent, we are strongly convinced (supported by<br>Raman spectroscopy data) that the main role in enhancing<br>iodine uptake is placed by the formation of partially<br>negatively charged oxygen moieties following on from the<br>addition of ChCl and the establishment of DES(-like)<br>HBA/HBD interactions.|\n\n"
