QUestion: Okay, here’s a breakdown of the valuable scientific questions raised by the reviewer, categorized for clarity:

**I. Conceptual & Theoretical Questions:**

1.  **Intergenerational Decision-Making Framework:** The reviewer pushes for a more nuanced understanding of the drivers of intergenerational decision-making, specifically challenging the “zero-sum” framing. The core question is: *What are the specific conditions and factors (beyond just “the future”) that motivate action towards future generations?*

2.  **Legacy vs. Generativity:** The reviewer directly questions the conflation of “legacy” and “generativity.” The key question is: *How can these constructs be clearly differentiated, and what are the distinct psychological mechanisms underlying each?* (This prompts a need for a more precise operational definition of each.)

3.  **Defining "Legacy":** The reviewer highlights the lack of a clear definition of “legacy.” The question is: *What is the operational definition of “legacy” being used in this research, and how is it being measured?* (This demands a citation and clarification.)



**II. Methodological & Analytical Questions:**

1.  **Variable Listing & Theoretical Breadth (Study 1):** The reviewer identifies a potential incompleteness in the list of variables influencing intergenerational decision-making. The question is: *What other relevant constructs should be included in the theoretical model, and how do they relate to legacy, generativity, and future self-continuity?* (The reference to Law, K. F., Colaizzi, G., & Syropoulos, S. (2025) provides a suggested expansion.)

2.  **Correlation Analysis (Study 1):** The reviewer raises a crucial concern about potential multicollinearity. The question is: *What are the correlations between all key variables in the model, and how can this be assessed to avoid issues in statistical analysis?*

3.  **Effect Sizes & Statistical Reporting (Both Studies):**  A recurring theme is the need for more robust statistical reporting. The questions are: *What effect sizes (e.g., Cohen’s d) should be reported for each comparison?*  *What p-value formatting (e.g., ** for p <.01, *** for p <.001) should be used?*



**III.  Clarification & Expansion of Findings:**

1.  **Outgroup Derogation & Ingroup Favoritism (Discussion):** The reviewer suggests a need to explore potential interventions to address outgroup derogation and ingroup favoritism. The question is: *What specific strategies or interventions could be implemented to mitigate these biases in intergenerational decision-making?*



Essentially, the reviewer is pushing for a more rigorous, nuanced, and methodologically sound investigation of the complex psychological factors driving intergenerational decision-making. They are highlighting the need for a clearer theoretical framework, more robust statistical analysis, and a deeper exploration of the underlying mechanisms at play. 

Do you want me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps focus on a specific section of the review?
