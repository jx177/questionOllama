(prompt: f"This is a review made based on a certain article. Identify all valuable scientific questions which are raised by the reviewer in the given text. \n The text : {review}")

QUestion: Okay, here’s a breakdown of the valuable scientific questions raised by the reviewer, categorized for clarity:
--
**I. Conceptual & Theoretical Questions:**

1.  **Intergenerational Decision-Making Framework:** The reviewer pushes for a more nuanced understanding of the drivers of intergenerational decision-making, specifically challenging the “zero-sum” framing. The core question is: *What are the specific conditions and factors (beyond just “the future”) that motivate action towards future generations?*

2.  **Legacy vs. Generativity:** The reviewer directly questions the conflation of “legacy” and “generativity.” The key question is: *How can these constructs be clearly differentiated, and what are the distinct psychological mechanisms underlying each?* (This prompts a need for a more precise operational definition of each.)

3.  **Defining "Legacy":** The reviewer highlights the lack of a clear definition of “legacy.” The question is: *What is the operational definition of “legacy” being used in this research, and how is it being measured?* (This demands a citation and clarification.)



**II. Methodological & Analytical Questions:**

1.  **Variable Listing & Theoretical Breadth (Study 1):** The reviewer identifies a potential incompleteness in the list of variables influencing intergenerational decision-making. The question is: *What other relevant constructs should be included in the theoretical model, and how do they relate to legacy, generativity, and future self-continuity?* (The reference to Law, K. F., Colaizzi, G., & Syropoulos, S. (2025) provides a suggested expansion.)

2.  **Correlation Analysis (Study 1):** The reviewer raises a crucial concern about potential multicollinearity. The question is: *What are the correlations between all key variables in the model, and how can this be assessed to avoid issues in statistical analysis?*

3.  **Effect Sizes & Statistical Reporting (Both Studies):**  A recurring theme is the need for more robust statistical reporting. The questions are: *What effect sizes (e.g., Cohen’s d) should be reported for each comparison?*  *What p-value formatting (e.g., ** for p <.01, *** for p <.001) should be used?*



**III.  Clarification & Expansion of Findings:**

1.  **Outgroup Derogation & Ingroup Favoritism (Discussion):** The reviewer suggests a need to explore potential interventions to address outgroup derogation and ingroup favoritism. The question is: *What specific strategies or interventions could be implemented to mitigate these biases in intergenerational decision-making?*



Essentially, the reviewer is pushing for a more rigorous, nuanced, and methodologically sound investigation of the complex psychological factors driving intergenerational decision-making. They are highlighting the need for a clearer theoretical framework, more robust statistical analysis, and a deeper exploration of the underlying mechanisms at play. 

Do you want me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps focus on a specific section of the review?

QUestion: Okay, here’s a breakdown of the valuable scientific questions raised by the reviewer, categorized for clarity:
--
**1. Regarding the Core Research Design & Intergenerational Dynamics:**

*   **What constitutes “intergenerational” in this design?** The reviewer fundamentally questions whether the online “intergenerational” game truly captures the dynamics of genuine intergenerational relationships. They argue the design mimics a standard dictator game, lacking the crucial element of the present generation’s direct stake in the future generation’s wellbeing – a key factor in real-world intergenerational interactions (like parental concern for children).
*   **Does the “generation story” matter?**  The reviewer pushes for an experimental condition to specifically test whether the *narrative* of multiple generations influences the results.  They want to know if simply labeling the game as “intergenerational” is sufficient, or if a more robust design is needed.
*   **What is the realistic applicability of the “outgroup” condition?** The reviewer challenges the design's definition of “outgroup.” They question if the game’s actions (affecting a future generation) are relevant to real-world scenarios. They suggest considering broader societal issues like climate change, which inherently affects both in- and outgroup future generations.

**2. Ethical Concerns & Deception:**

*   **Is the deception justified?** The reviewer repeatedly raises the ethical concerns about the deceptive use of multiple “generations” when only one future generation is involved. They argue that the use of deception is not justified by the study's scientific value.
*   **Were the second generation participants truly recruited and assessed?** The reviewer questions whether the second generation participants were actually recruited, paid, and confirmed to be members of the intended ingroup or outgroup.


**3. Broader Implications & Generalizability:**

*   **Can the findings be generalized?** The reviewer is skeptical about whether the results can be applied to broader societal issues, given the artificial nature of the experimental design. They push for a more nuanced discussion of the design’s limitations and potential applications. 



Would you like me to elaborate on any of these questions, or perhaps focus on a specific category?

QUestion: Okay, here’s a breakdown of the valuable scientific questions raised by the reviewer, based on the provided text:
--
1.  **Matching of the Second Generation (Study 1):** The reviewer explicitly asks for a description of *how* the second generation participants in Study 1 were matched. This highlights a key methodological gap and raises the question: **What criteria were used to select the second-generation participants?**  This is crucial for assessing the realism and potential biases introduced by this specific matching procedure.

2.  **Nature of the Deception & Its Impact:** While the reviewer acknowledges the clarity improvements, the core concern remains. The reviewer is implicitly asking: **To what extent does the deceptive nature of the experimental setup (regarding multiple future generations) influence the observed ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation?**  This is a fundamental question about the validity of the findings – are the results genuinely reflecting intergenerational dynamics, or are they skewed by the artificiality of the scenario?

3.  **Understanding the Underlying Mechanisms:** The review doesn't directly ask this, but the identified issues suggest a broader question: **What psychological mechanisms are driving the observed intergenerational ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation?**  The deception element raises the possibility that the results are not simply about age, but about how individuals respond to perceived future relationships and economic incentives within a manipulated scenario.

4.  **Generalizability Beyond National Contexts:** While the reviewer notes the clarification about ISDGs, the question lingers: **How robust are these findings when considering different cultural or national contexts?**  The paper attempts to address this with the “minimal vs. national” statement, but a deeper exploration of potential contextual influences is warranted.



**Important Note:** The reviewer’s comments are focused on methodological refinement and addressing potential weaknesses. They aren't posing entirely new research questions, but they are pointing out areas where the study's interpretation and potential impact are contingent on a clearer understanding of the experimental design and its implications.
